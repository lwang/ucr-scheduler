There is assigned readings but not really any hw besides readings and essays, I only remember having to write like a paragraph and turn it in online. She links back readings and videos we watch in class to lectures, expects a mention or 2 in your essays, and many questions on the midterm and final are based on them. In short, doing the readings, they're pretty important. Her TAs can be strict or lenient, pray on that, as they grade your 3 essays. McMullin is very much lenient herself, she gave us an extra credit opportunity for 30 free points on our 200 point midterm and even gave us the final's essay questions as take home. \n\nTLDR: Easy class, IF you do the readings. DO READINGS. ",

Pray that your TA is lenient, because the essay rubrics are very subjective (10 points can be docked off resulting in a B- just for \"lack of persuasiveness\".) Do the readings, the exams are based on them and lecture. Overall, the material is not difficult, but the grading is sooo subjective, even for the exams.",

I will be honest though, he is incredibly difficult to understand due to his thick accent, but if you read the book he provides you, the class is incredibly easy. The quizzes are very straightforward and short, the exams are exactly what he describes them to be. My TA Johanna Najera was also super nice and she is very knowledgable on the topics that we learn. She also worked with the professor on various excavations that he went to. Overall a pretty easy and engaging class, just make sure you show up to every lecture because he asks mini quiz questions throughout every lecture. ",

When you register, it shows the class and studio time. It's one after the other, so you're there for nearly 3 hours. Don't get discouraged by the time, it's necessary to have a long class for art because of the activities you're doing and sometimes there will be critiques - where everyone goes around to talk about what they liked about the drawing and what could be improved/done differently. Attendance is mandatory, if you miss one class you can miss out on a lot if it was on a critique day. Your homework is 3 large drawings each week, and she gives you a theme for the drawings, it's all still life for the most part. This class does require you to buy art supplies.",

The first half taught by Dr. Dingwall was more structured and I think easier to follow along with because it is similar to other underdiv wet lab courses. The second half that was taught by Dr. Fan was a lot more difficult for me mainly because it was unlike any other class I had taken before. You had to use this other online software to analyze molecules and you basically just followed along as Dr. Fan would show you what to do. Homework was assigned weekly and that wasn't too bad as long as you paid attention during lecture. Overall, the class isn't difficult; it's just tedious and requires a lot of time. ",

I actually really enjoyed it, most of my friends didn't attend lecture if it was their first class and still got A's (I got an A-). One thing to watch out for is he will try to trick you on the midterms (all multiple choice): you will read the question, immediately know the answer, and when you get the midterm back realize you read it wrong! Be sure to read each midterm question carefully, and if you are choosing \"the obvious answer\" read the question and think of the concept carefully. Beyond that, he is hilarious, the videos are hilarious, but the lecture/OH is a bit boring (he repeats himself... a lot). Still, most I know really struggle with Bio 5A, Maduro knows this and tries to give us as much help as possible without throwing A's at us. He'll give you every exam he's ever written (some going back to 2006 I think?), do them all! Oh, and a pro-tip I wish I discovered sooner: the video have a \"view captions\" tab, and most of the quiz questions (which halt the video) are discussed right after in the script, so you can look there \"to confirm your answer\".",

Joseph is an exceptional teacher and organizes his slides in a very efficient and easy to understand way. I definitely learned more from Joseph. Some of the information he teaches coincides with what you learn in Chem 1B (for the first few weeks at least). Yang is not as good in terms of clarity and presentation of information, but he will gladly answer questions and explain topics more thoroughly if need be. Both professors opted for online videos that you could watch at any time. Yang held his Zoom lecture at the scheduled time, but also uploaded said lecture online. There are two midterms and a final and it was all open book. As long as you take detailed notes from the slides, you will earn a good grade. ",

He also post study questions for each lecture that are crucial for doing good on the test. This is a memorization class but his questions really helped you pinpoint what you should know for the exams as his exams were fair and reflected the study questions he posted.

He does recorded lectures with set of notes and holds live office hours. The videos can be long and kind of boring because of his monotone voice. I recommend you read the notes before you start the videos, that way you learn and retain more during the videos. There are 2 noncumulative midterms, 3 noncumulative quizzes, and 1 cumulative final. Please take this class seriously and study at least one week before each exam or quiz. Dr. Kelly did a great job of providing \"What you need to know\" slides at the end of each lecture so that you can really pinpoint what to study. There is NO CURVE and NO EC. I also recommend doing well on the very first midterm as that will set the stage and also get 100% on your lab portion as that is 25% of your final grade and can really give you that boost.

The prelab quiz are really easy and a quick skim though the lab manual you can get full credit on those quizzes. For the 3 major quizzes thought the quarter, really focus on the results and the procedures and look over the worksheets and you will be good. This quarter (Fall 2019) I thought the lab final was cake, as it was just all the worksheets and the practice exam that were on the exam, but do study if you want high grade. I think they might've change the 5LA final because people previous quarters told me it was very difficult and stuff on it wasn't learned, but that wasn't the case this quarter.",

The midterm and exam weren't too difficult. Honestly, if you just find random quizlets with accounting questions and use those to study, chances are that you'll see similar questions on his exams. The prof doesn't really teach - he just shows you how to do textbook problems without explaining anything. He assigned us weekly quizzes, but I didn't find them that useful. They only showed us what types of questions he was going to give us on the exams. He also didn't give us a practice midterm or final which I thought was inconsiderate, considering we were online and he wasn't that good of a professor. The TAs were also barely useful. They would just upload videos explaining the answers to quizzes, but those explanations weren't that good in my opinion. I think that this class was manageable, but not a good experience. ",

                "comment": "The other answer on this explains it pretty well already - Professor Jasso caps the assignments at a B+/A- for some reason. The worst part of the class is that it's at 7:30 AM, so he knows that a lot of people aren't going to attend lecture. Honestly, he's a cool dude and pretty funny at times, but he can be THAT professor that takes attendance when he sees that people aren't showing up. There are weekly reading assignments that you have to write in 10 pt font single space. You get used to it and it really doesn't seem that bad when writing - the reading part is what takes a lot. In the syllabus there's a format for all the readings, so make sure you answer the questions, using the key words of the format. The TAs are going to receive hundreds of 3 pages of 10 pt font single space assignments, they're not going to read it word for word. For the midterms (2 separate days of 2 questions out of 4, so one day one question, the other day another), Jasso is going to choose it by random. He crumbles up papers with the question numbers on them, makes students switch it around, and reveals it in front of the class. With all this entertainment, the midterm and the final (that's during week 10, but choosing 2 out of 5 questions) only allow for 30 minutes of writing time. On the exams, he does say to reference lecture for some of them. It's hard to go to this class with it being so early in the morning, but hopefully you all have the drive to do it. If you do end up not going to class, try your best for the ones before the midterms and finals. He might talk about it. If this is one of the first core classes you take, brace yourself for another Jasso class with the same format (BUS103).",

On the first day you'll be able to assign yourself to a group on a spreadsheet - there will be two group presentations every lecture to go over the homework problems. The professor walks you through the logic of the homework problems but you'll have to set up Excel yourself. He gives you a template in PDF form so you can't copy and paste it onto Excel, but you have an idea of what you have to do. The first midterm is one question that was similar to the homework question. That's all I can say for the class cause the rest I didn't even try, sorry. Seems like a pretty useful class. ",

                "comment": "[COVID-19] I took this class with Ye Li and it was honestly a really good class. At first, it was annoying that he sends out about 5 emails reminding you to do the web assignment before the first lecture (basically a ~15 minute survey for every class that relates to the lesson - he collects the students' stats to present in class). The professor is pretty lenient with the web assignments being submitted a little bit late, but that's not the case for the write ups. In the class besides the web assignments, there are 5 write-ups (with assigned readings ranging from like 5 to 15 pages, a big one being 30ish) in total that you need to do out of 8 offered in 10 weeks. The first two write ups (counted as 1) is with a randomly assigned group and was 600 words each. The rest, you are free to chose as long as you have done 5. There's no midterm and only a final - the final you have the option to go solo or choose a partner/have the professor choose one for you. The final is about a case study with 6 questions and all he tells you is that you have to use class concepts for it. You have 5 days to complete it and it had a word limit of 2000. The professor is great, he makes every topic interesting and has a lot of opportunities for extra credit throughout the quarter. Should basically be a pretty easy A class as long as you make the effort to do the web assignments and write ups. They're due every Thursday but if you turn it in the Sunday before, you get an extra credit point added to your score. I'd really recommend this class as an elective! My concentration is IS and this was definitely one of the easier classes I've taken and it was genuinely a good class. ",

The book is not required, you just need to purchase an access code for BUS 165 series, this code will be used for the entire series (A-C). Attendance is mandated and points are deducted for every lecture missed. There's a total of 20 points, miss 10 lectures, you receive no participation points when calculating grades. The course is challenging, yes, however, study well and try to achieve the highest possible score possible on each assignment (homework, pre-lecture quizzes, tests, etc.). You will need to keep track of the assignments due after and before each week as he does not remind you, and it's a lot of assignments if you don't keep up. The class is graded based upon the weighted grade or total points achieved, whichever one is higher. This is a class where if you don't put in work, you will fail, even if the professor says \"85% of the class will get a B- or higher\". Exams will have questions from the CPA exam. Overall, if you think accounting upper divs is an easy A, this major/concentration is not for you. ",

One midterm and one final (noncumulative) with most questions from the textbook and a few made by him based on the homework. There are about 4 homework assignments spread out evenly, so make sure to start a little earlier. He has extended one homework before due to some students being unable to install Microsoft Office software properly, but be reasonable and don't start the day before it's due and ask for an extension lol. Two out of four were using Microsoft Access. The last homework is always a small research paper where you have to explain a concept (for this class it was the difference between relational databases and NoSQL).

Based off her CHE110A, I assume the final won't be any harder either. Material covered: Real/ideal gas states, energy balance, engines, entropy, steam tables. Some of the HW assignments take forever to do and she was inconsistent with the points allotted for each assignment. Overall, okay class if you know how ideal and real gases work and understand engines well.",

Has a thick accent but sets up the class in a way that makes it super difficult to fail (you seriously need to not do anything to not get points). He has a redemption system so you can get points back if your final exam grade is much higher than your midterm exam scores. All of his exams have extra credit problems that he will give you to do before the exam day (yay!), but he has no curve. So scores on the exams depend entirely up to you. Homework is an easy 100% as long as you do it before the deadline and gives you unlimited attempts and no score penalties (unlike other professors that I have known). ",

He has a slightly condescending attitude which could be very offputting/intimidating for a student  who wants additional help or ask extra questions. His midterm was a bit difficult, the final was unexpectedly difficult, but he gave the class a MASSIVE curve and even curved the final grade; aside from the curve, the saving grace for me was that I had a a really good T.A. though I know plenty others who weren't as lucky. He was ok, not terrible (though many others would say he was), but if you have the option to avoid him, I would. But if you do end up with him, it's not really a big deal, just try to adjust around his personality, I guess. He's also extremely conceptual, and his exams heavily reflect that  (hence, the difficulty), so you have to make sure you 110% understand concepts and how to apply that. If you only understand the concepts on a surface level, you won't do so hot on the tests. Also, homework is optional and not graded, so really try to understand literally everything on it if you want to ace the exams.",

Form study groups early bc discussions seemed to help my LC. I hated this class with a passion. Tests are difficult, especially when you aren't told what you missed points for. STUDY the practice tests that he posts and any test from him that you can get your hands on bc he likes to recycle questions. We had this one question that was on both midterms and the final. There's also two midterms, but he only takes the higher grade. gl if you get stuck w bartels",

It's a great transition from high school chemistry to college chemistry(especially if you took AP chem in HS). He's a pretty good prof and very kind and helpful. Midterm 1 was not too bad but he made midterm 2 harder on purpose to get the average score lower, but he does curve based on that. Midterm average is usually in the C range but it will be curved to a B- which is pretty generous. Go to lecture because he explains concepts that will be on the exam very well and does virtual clicker questions that you have to do bc they count towards your grade. The only concept he was kinda bad at teaching was hybridization so I'd recommend going to SI sessions for that. Overall, if you put in the work and don't slack off you'll be fine.",

I sought out outside resources such as the ARC's tutoring and YouTube videos that greatly contributed to my understanding of the material.

Just review the end of chapter problems, do the practice midterm, review the clicker questions, and the homework before the midterms/final and you'll be set!

Attending the Zoom lecture was recommended and he occasionally tossed in some clicker questions to reward those who actively attended. Chem 1B builds off of the information you learned in Chem 1A so it's good to brush up on some of those topics. Like others are saying, this class is a lot of equations and plugging and chugging. The word problems are tricky too. Each chapter was a new concept for me, so it took me a while (and a lot of Khan Academy...) to fully understand the concepts and how the equations worked. Reading the textbook is extremely helpful and he bases most of his exam questions off of what he teaches on the slides. Zhao presents his information pretty thoroughly and takes the time to help students who are stuck. This class moves fairly quickly, so understanding all of the concepts is vital to earning a good grade. Unfortunately, the exams are all closed book and proctored. Clicker questions (20%), discussion points (10%), and homework (20%) make up 50% of the grade (as well as potential bonus points). For us, the homework had unlimited tries and there was no penalty for wrong answers. There are 2 midterms (10% each) and a final (30%). The exams aren't curved (I think), but the final class grade is based on a curve. Overall, I enjoyed this class a lot and I recommend taking it with Zhao!",

If you read/ skim the book (for the conceptual questions) and do calculations similar to the ones on the homework, you can get good scores on midterms. Final he repeated questions from midterms so do go to office hours and TA office hours to see your exam and review the ones missed. 1C material isn't hard but the chapter on acid and base and its equilibria was I thought the hardest.

Highly recommend not taking with Jiang if you don't already have experience with gen chem (ex: taking a year of chem in high school/ap chem) because he can tend to be very conceptual instead of mathematical (and the midterms are mathematical). The poll/clicker questions can be pretty difficult because he doesn't really teach them beforehand so you're kind of learning as you go. The homework can also be frustrating because in the later chapters he doesn't do a lot of practice problems that are similar to what's on the homework. The midterms are pretty ok as long as you review the quizzes, poll/clicker questions, and homework. Practice midterm was helpful too because he goes over it in class.

The content of this class is difficult and definitely requires a lot of studying, but his exams are fair. The problem sets are optional but definitely help a lot in preparing for exams. He grades fairly and he also allows regrades on Gradescope. He handwrites all his notes and they are really neat. Dr. Kou is probably one of the best professors at UCR and I highly recommend taking his class. He also bumps you up a grade letter if you are borderline.

Finally, if your TA isn't helpful, don't be afraid to go to another ta who can explain concepts better.",

Many people found out the hard way that their \"raw score\" didn't not exactly correlate with their final score. (e.g. 94% raw score is actually a B in the class because Hooley gave out letter grades after \"adding the normalized lab scores (average ~200), the lab exam (average ~230), ranking the class and assigning grades based on that ranking.

However, Toby made the class harder as a result of people taking the class for an easy A. The labs are an easy 3 hours of homework. The midterms are worded pretty confusingly, and he stopped telling everyone what exactly would be on the test as previous reviews have stated. The professor gets pissed pretty easily so beware. I ended up getting close to an A, but I spent a LOT of time outside of class. The material itself is not difficult, but the midterms can be difficult. Also, he stopped posting his lectures online, so attending lecture is a must. Overall, the class is not super difficult but it for sure is not an easy A, especially if you aren't a compsci major. ",

He does all of his assignments via Zybooks. Tip for the class, plan out your schedule because every week, there's 5 activities that you have to complete every week (some of them might be really short, some of them might take a long time).

He'll usually give hints to what it is during class. He'll talk about some concept for 30 seconds and will say \"ya this might be on your midterm\" and then never talk about it again. When I took it with him, the theme of our midterm was compiler flags. It's basically his way of figuring out whether you went to class or not. Also, its his way of ensuring that if you only study the mock midterm he posts like the night before, you will fail, because he changes the themes every couple of quarters. The night before my midterm, he posted a mock midterm that completely revolved around argc and argv[], and because I studied just that, I completely bombed the midterm the next day, which like I said before, mostly revolved around compiler flags.  \n\nIf you take anything from this, just do your assignments on time, go to class, and take note on anything that he says \"might be on the exam\" and you can basically predict what questions will end up on the exam.

CS012 is filled with content, and you have to be on your toes and learn quickly. If you find yourself falling behind then make sure to quickly get help via office hours. Both professors and TAs have office hours, and there is SI sessions as well. This course is not too bad up until the midterm, but the stuff after is very hard. Pointers, Linked Lists, and Recursion are all difficult topics, which difficult programming assignments. I found myself having to collaborate with people to get through the assignments, even though you are not allowed to collaborate. Please make sure you do not use GitHub code on your assignments, that's how many people got caught. Instead, get help from friends, TAs, and professors, they will often lead you in the right path and that way you make sure that you are learning the material.

Best advice I can give is make a study group so you guys can help each other understand the concepts. Pointers, linked lists, and recursion are some of the hardest concepts in this class. Really try your best to understand everything well and ask your TA for help! They\u2019re very nice and want you to do well. Also if you\u2019re struggling with concepts from CS010 don\u2019t be afraid to ask because everything builds on it. Overall it\u2019s a hard class but if you take the time each week to understand the readings and assignments, it\u2019ll be slightly less painful.",

Data Structures and Algorithms is an initially scary class as the jump/learning curve from CS012 was drastic and you had to be really confident in your ability to program. If you don't understand the concepts from the previous class, beware, this class will be difficult programming-wise. Conceptual understanding wasn't a problem, as LePendu really makes sure people nail that portion of the subject. It's not too difficult of a class but taking it online because of COVID-19 did add some learning struggles. The midterm was easy but the final was HARD. I do wish that some of the programming labs that were smaller in size would be 1-person labs as working on them with a group meant you didn't do much coding on your own. More coding practice would've been better as all technical interviews pull from the knowledge you learn in CS014.

Midterm was decently hard, but again similar to a previous quarters midterm. I believe i received a 95% on the midterm. The class as a whole though 18% got an A on the midterm. Final was much tougher. (remember, you need 70% or higher to pass the class). I believe the uncurved average was something like 55%. Lucky for us, he bell curved it to increase the average to 66.6%. I would have failed the class, but luckily ended up with a 72% on the final after the curve. Programming assignments aren't too hard. Labs are killer. Homework is ok, just at least attempt you'll get 100. The midterm and final is the toughest part of the class. It's pretty much a mandatory class for a lot of BCOE majors though, so good luck",

However, if you asked him during office hours the attention he gives you individually really helps you understand. The grading is pretty strict, but he's been known to give exceptions to some people (for example, I was allowed to turn in HW late, I'm a girl so idk if that has anything to do with it or my friend who's black also was caught cheating but was allowed to re-submit his assignment and passed the course). DON'T CHEAT! My friends got caught. He puts specific things in the template to catch the cheating. Also the TA Robert Colvin was the most helpful, but you have to walk through this logic in your head with him or classmates, or you'll never be able to catch up from falling off the boat at the early part of the term. The HW was pretty easy and even if you have the wrong answer, as long as you gave a credible, honest working to your solution, they'll assume you did it right and give you full marks. There are 5 projects and are pretty annoying because they go through an auto-grader in gradescope, so start early. Correspondance in the course goes through piazza, which is a bit annoying. The quizzes are pretty hard, but open book/resources. The final for our term (Fall 2019) was unlike anyone's final and REALLY bad. The midterm is hard but if you overkill yourself studying it's really not that bad. He gives plenty of resources to help. 70% of the midterm/final is multiple choice anyway.",

It's a huge learning curve from writing small programs to designing and coding an entire Linux Shell throughout the course. The design patterns may seem easy to understand in the slides, but when asked to apply them, will be difficult. Do yourself a favor and ASK FOR HELP. For the first couple of weeks I went to the professor's office hours almost every chance I got. \n\nI would ask the professor questions that I would consider to be base knowledge for many students, and Professor Crites was more than helpful in answering my questions and informing me on what I should catch up on in terms of prereq knowledge. Super approachable professor who will go out of his way to help you. The tests aren't all too bad if you review the slides and understand the gist of the design patterns. \n\nThe assignments and labs are what you should focus on if you want to pass the class. If you do well on them you can pass the class on the basis of labs and assignments alone. The main project that you will be working on throughout the course does not really require any specific design pattern, so it's up to you to decide how you will design it. My advice for the assignment is think of the long term and make sure that your code is flexible and able to add features relatively easily. Otherwise you will run into the issue that I and many students have in this class where you will find yourself rewriting your code almost every assignment in order to meet spec and make things work. You will not be allowed to switch partners for assignments (at least I don't think) so choose your partner wisely. \n\nLabs aren't too bad, except the instructions for the labs can seem kind of vague at times and most of the time will be spent figuring out what the hell you're actually supposed to do or what the output is supposed to be. But once you understand the instructions it's not too bad. \n\nDO NOT, wait until the day or even a few days before your assignment is due to start your code. I've tried it, don't bring that stress and anxiety upon yourself like I did. You will lose your mind. You will question your major. Don't give up, always ask for help and everything will be okay. ",

Labs are chill if you have a good partner, but beware of the hammer server, it's such a pain to use.\n\nThe midterm was so bad he had to curve. The final on the other hand was MUCH easier, split up into two days so the final lecture was the multiple choice portion and the scheduled final day was the conceptual/written portion. Make sure you know how to draw UML diagrams properly because they will show up on both midterm and final.\n\nThe assignments are basically the final project but split up into 4 assignments, so each assignment builds from the previous one. You have to build a C++ shell, and he does not teach any of this during lecture so read up on it early before he starts posting assignments. If you screw up an assignment, you have to go back and fix it before you move onto the next one. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A GOOD PARTNER.

The grader for the course, Luis Garcia, was one I had to constantly fight with because he graded things super late. He graded our major class assignments during Week 11. Crites also added \"ethics assignments\" that I think as a minority are pretty insensitive. One was \"define your personal definition of hate speech\", wtf?

She assigned the final project in week 8 and gave us week 10 midterm alongside it. Much of the lectures only broadly go over the topics and the slides are ripped from websites and YouTube videos. The slides themselves are unhelpful and hard to follow. Her instructions are also very unclear on her expectations and even if she says she's aiming to give you freedom in your choice of how you do the project, she will grade you harshly. The class itself is not that difficult, but just do not take it with her at all costs. The only reason I struggled was due to her.",

I think most people in my class can agree that she does a poor job at teaching the class. She speeds through the powerpoint, and changes homework questions the night before assigning them ( from last years hw questions ), leaving some problems very difficult to solve since she hasn't worked out the answers yet. For one homework assignment she even had to change a homework question 3 times because she didn't check the difficult of it beforehand. A lot of the hw questions are very vague and require meeting with a TA to understand how to solve. In terms of quizzes, she give a quiz 'syllabus' and 'sample' quizzes for each quiz, which is nice, but the material on the actual quizzes were very different than the sample ones. She actually gives quite a bit of extra credit for the quizzes though, so keep that in mind. Usually in class, she'll give you a timed ~5min problem than you can choose to answer for extra credit ( 1-2 points ) that gets added to the next quiz. At the end of the quarter she also give an extra credit quiz worth ~9 quiz points, if you can prove a few of the really challenging proofs she goes over through the course. In total, the amount of extra credit you could potentially get was close to 15 points which is 50% of a quiz grade ( out of 30 points normally ). The final was on the difficult side, with the average around 60% but she slightly curves it, so that the average is around 65/70%. Overall, prepare to spend a lot of time outside of the class on this course.   ",

Around half of the questions will be similar to the provided sample quizzes, but the last questions are going to be related to using proofs from lecture. If given the chance, do the homework before the quizzes.

Quiz syllabi are very helpful in preparation for quizzes. If you just so happen to be taking a math class while taking this class I suggest asking your math TA for help on the hw rather than the TA's for this class (at least for the proofs, I don't think they can help with run times). Homework must be done in latex. If you study hard leading up to the quizzes (and not just the night before) you should do fine. Just don't slack off, this class really can be time consuming.

Do the problems on the quiz syllabuses and the practice quizzes, as they definitely help out. Elena is an alright lecturer, but be sure to pay attention as a lot of the material builds off each other. \nOur final was online cause of COVID-19, open note and on zoom, but pretty concept based.

Elena often gives us 5-10 to upload exam material to iLearn - hard if you\u2019re uploading pictures.\n\nFinal grade was composed of grade on final exam and grade on quizzes. I highly recommend doing well on quizzes (80% or higher, if possible). Elena allowed us to replace bad scores on the quizzes with practice problems (similar to those we got wrong). After the final, Elena required us to state whether we cheated or not (submit pdf on Gradescope).Elena has a very strong, somewhat annoying, emphasis on cheating - to the point where it's very annoying.\n\nElena also almost always never posts the submission links for homework until you tell her to. For example, if homework is due Wednesday 11:59 pm and you don\u2019t see the submission link at Tuesday 8 pm, email her to tell her to release the submission. \n\n",

She allowed us to use our notes during the midterm and final. Overall the homeworks weren't that difficult, just tedious sometimes. Labs can be rough in the beginning, but once you get used to the program you have to use, the labs should only give you trouble with writing the programs in verilog. That being said always ask for help when you don't know how to do something in verilog. My TA and lab mates were a great help and made the labs super short(30-45 mins) towards the end of the quarter. I also had to do a final project with a partner during the last 2 weeks, which wasn't that bad. You have 3 projects to chose from. ",

The average on both midterms was a 62%. Stefano does curve, he drops lowest scoring question on both the midterms and the final. The midterms were 4 questions/25 points each, the final was 10 questions/10 points each. The class itself is curved, the A range is 100-80%, B is 70-79.9%, C is 60-69.9%.. etc. So you are given that 10% grace.

You must study the material as soon as you can; otherwise, you'll feel really left behind, and it will result in you not knowing what the hell you're writing about on your quizzes and/or homework assignments. After Greedy and DP, you deal with shortest path algorithms, which weren't super difficult, but still left an impact on you.

Homeworks are hard, I had to cave in and get a chegg subscription to answer some problems because getting as many points as possibly is crucial in this course. Homeworks are similar to CS111 in the sense that it may ask you to apply a concept to answer a problem that doesn't have examples available to study from. That in mind, pay attention to homework and study the solutions because some showed up on the exam with some changes. Exam questions are hard, but easier than the homework IMO. Didn't mean I did good though cause I couldn't do the majority of hw problems without online help. You'll need to know the pseudocode for the algorithms in the slides because a couple will show up on the exam, in the sense that you need to write down the exact pseudocode or will have to use it as a part of your answer. There might be one or two really easy questions, but they'll be easy if you remember what its asking for like recurrence relations/master theorem/drawing huffman tree. Lectures are useful especially for greedy and dynamic programming, please don't skip for those or the slides won't make any sense. Plenty of people that skipped had issues with these. Only lectures I would recommend skipping are the first one(just talks about big O) and the last couple ones since what you need to know are pseudocodes for the graph algorithms.\n\nTLDR: Its a hard class. Exams and homework are hard. Exams get curved. Lectures are great, helps with understanding the info the majority of the time. Still, even if its a terrible experience you'll learn quite a lot concepts for interview questions. Also grading scale is 10% lowered. I.e A = 80-100%, B = 70-80%...D=50-60% so on and so forth.

The class itself is tough, but imo not as tough as 141. Make sure you understand each topic, as each builds off of each other. The homework is a good gauge on how well you know the material.

LePendu is passionate about this subject, and doesn't want anyone to not pass; he gives out extra credit opportunities on the homeworks, occasional quizzes, and on the tests.

Final is non-cumulative. Phase 1 and 2 could be done in a single day if you wanted to. For Phase 3, they give you a good example in the slides that's completed in C++. You can choose to complete Phase 3 in C++ or C, but you need to take extra steps to implement in C++. There's some good info about that on stackoverflow and the bison documentation. You will get at least 70/100 points on Phase 3 if you implement enough stuff, so even if it doesn't pass the test cases, you should be fine if the implementation makes sense. It also has to compile on the bolt server without errors or else you will get a 0; they won't fix your makefile for you.

He gave us all the topics before the tests as well some previous exam questions that ended up on the tests. Homework questions also appeared on the tests. The average for the midterm was a around high 70 percent I think.  Though, maybe this'll change so watch out. Also, and I'm not sure if the other people that reviewed the class had the same lab manual as us, the labs were fairly straightforward. The manuals tell you all the code changes you need to do in the sense that it tells you what functions to change and in what file. Though it can be hard to actually implement the changes you need to do. \nTLDR: Exams and homework fairly decent in terms of difficultly. Labs are the hardest part, but always ask for help from others or TA when you're stuck.

To illustrate my point, the class average was a 90% in the class. A 90%. However, because its by percentile, even if your raw grade was a 90+%, you will get curved DOWN unless you did better than 90+% of the class.

One project at the end of the class, not too bad, implementing some sql and stuff with user input and a java wrapper. 4 homeworks from the book.

Additionally, every 3 weeks or so, you write a story consideration (3-5 pages) in regards to your final project (5-10 pages). 20 points come from lecture + discussion attendance. Hated lecture, enjoyed discussion. Hated reading responses, didn't mind the other assignments. Also, idk what the final is bc he cancelled it when I took it (Fall '19).",

I ended up feeling violated, seriously. Jennifer was nice, but naive at times about how uncomfortable people were. Don\u2019t tell people to lie down for massages, Jen. Not everyone wants a full body massage. Anyways, contact improvisation is a very touchy class . So, if you\u2019re the type of person who wouldn\u2019t mind giving someone a full body massage, take it. If you\u2019d feel weird and grossed out about it and wouldn\u2019t want someone you may barely know, DO NOT take it. Don\u2019t make the same mistake that I did!!!",

All of the exams are multiple choice and are very similar to the homework problems. So do your homework problems as practice before the exam!

                "comment": "It's the stock market class (business elective) with Professor Silviu Velovici. It's kind of hard to say how difficult the class is due to the project that he gave us last minute. Cheat sheets are allowed for the two midterms and the final. The midterms are based on the homework, but he switches the questions slightly (ex: \"increase\" from homework to \"decrease\" on midterm). It's basically a class with a lot of accounting stuff. He came up with a group project the Monday before Thanksgiving break, so we had to find group members outside of class and not within our discussion. So many people sent out emails to find a group and other members, so it probably delayed a lot of people in starting it. Since it was so last minute I thought it was pretty disorganized - I'm pretty sure no one wants to finish up a project during their break. The final ended up being based on the project, so just doing your part in the project probably wouldn't have been enough to know everything. It was decided that he was going to take the 3 best grades out of 2 midterms, the project, and the final. So make sure you do well on at least 3 of those. I think it's a class worth looking at, but the best experience would be going to lecture and actually knowing all the material for the group project if he decides to do it again. He's a pretty cool and funny guy - since very few people showed up to the lecture right before Thanksgiving he gave out some extra credit. ",

Just make sure to do your homework to get a good understanding. A lot of the questions on your homework are harder than the ones on the midterm and final. She gives out study guides in the same format as the midterm and finals. You use zybooks to learn MATLAB which is really good program if you've taken cs010A before. She also recorded all the lectures and uploads all the slides",

Extra credit is given, both before the midterm and after the midterm. I believe in our quarter 300 extra points could be earned by doing all the extra credit. If you do everything and put in a decent amount of effort, this class shouldn't be too bad. The workshops were often only 30 minutes or less. Time consuming, but difficulty wise not too bad.",

I can't stress enough, for group assignments make sure all members of your group follow the writing guidelines or everyone in the group loses points. I easily could have gotten an A in the class, but I had to do all of the heavy lifting for 3 other people in my group and couldn't focus on writing my extra credit essays.\n\nEssays:\nLong, tedious, and professors are annoyingly strict on their \"writing guidelines\". Very straight forward though. Set aside like a Saturday morning to bang out an essay and you'll be fine.\n\nExtra Credit:\nDO ALL EXTRA CREDIT. The class offers so many opportunities to make up any points you lost because of dumb mistakes on assignments.

There's presentations, homework like weekly, etc. It's just very tedious to do but not difficult whatsoever (unless English is not your first language, then you might be in some trouble). Just make sure you follow their guidelines religiously. They will dock your grade mercilessly for each assignment if you don't follow their rules. \nAlso, there is group work and a stand-up presentation involved. The group is assigned in like week 2 or something and you work with them until week 10. If you get lazy/inattentive group members like I did, your grade will suffer and there's not much you can do about it. You might just have to suck it up and make up for their apathy by doing twice the work.

The finals consists of a 1500 word essay and two 500 word essays which have to do with the in class reading \"The Glass Castle\". Let me tell you...read the book the whole way through, or you WILL NOT pass this final. Basically, she assigns the fourth essay and 3 finals essays to complete in less than three weeks with no exceptions. ALSO...USE HER OFFICE HOURS...you get to read your drafts to her and she will give grammatical and content suggestions to improve your essays and also gives suggestions as to how you can use remaining days to refocus or bulk up what you are writing.",

He's very very meticulous with how he wants his assignments done and it was fairly overwhelming for a majority of the class for at least the first half of the quarter. He has a strange personality, but you can tell he's extremely passionate about his students and his career, often staying hours after his office hours to individually help his students. Three take home essays (with a crazy amount of prep time for each), one in-class essay, essay final, a few homework assignments that are basically just research and prep for your essays, and some group quizzes. You are allowed to skip the final IF you are doing well in the class (I think A's in essay 1+2) and you get at least an A- for the in-class essay. He sometimes gives opportunities to redo an essay (for a slight penalty) if you did particularly poorly or missed some key criteria required for said essay. The essays are graded pretty harshly and he is a stickler on sentence structure and grammar, but going to office hours and asking for his advice on your essay is the best way to get a good grade. Not a lot of reading other than some pages from the textbook occasionally and one pretty good book. He does make you watch some movies in the last half of the quarter, but you can do that on your own time and it's one movie a week basically. Most of his class revolves around teaching students the basics of writing and how to use the library/other sources properly. Throughout the quarter, he guides you through the process of how to write/prep the essays, especially the first essay, and he doesn't just expect a multiple page essay out of nowhere. The weeks leading up to an essay due date will be almost exclusively used for teaching you how to approach a certain type of essay or how to use a database to get research information for your essay and etc. Almost every lecture is tailored into helping your assignments out in some way. Having complex sentences and flow in your essays will get you a high grade. His class is certainly not an easy A, or even an easy B, but an A is absolutely achievable. If you want to actually take to heart what is being taught and genuinely want to become more proficient in English, take his class.",

It's more about how he words his prompts and him understanding your topic to the prompts. Very confusing, so it's recommended to go to his office hours. Attendance was not mandatory, and honestly was not necessary since whatever he talked about during class was not relevant or helpful to your essays. The only days you need to attend are the days he set for your oral presentations and the days right before the essay is due, this is when he asks for your topic ideas and he'll talk about some. He assigned readings before each lecture from two books, 1984 (Orwell) and Brave New World (Aldous Huxley), but I passed without needing to read the whole book.

She assigns so much work, and doesn't announce quizzes because \"they're on the syllabus\" (17 pages might I add). She reports people to academic misconduct for plagiarism without even informing them. Literally half the people in her class (including myself) dropped because of the heavy workload. Essay prompts were confusing and boring. She claims the workload is the same for all ENGL001B classes, but when I retook the class with Lorelei Baughman, we had exponentially AND significantly way less work compared to Rory Moore. Speaking of Lorelei Baughman, she's an absolute sweetheart, and an amazing professor. At one point she was wondering why we hardly asked questions, and our class had to explain to her that she does an absolute fine job at explaining. Encourages us to reach out to her. if you ever see her class open TAKE IT. Our class focused on food, and she always assigned these fun readings. Our final was easy, essay prompts were easy. She teared up when we told her at the end of the quarter how much we would miss her class. ",

As a result, she changed the original structure of the course from: 10% reading exam, 20% difficulty assignment, 30% discussion participation, 25% final essay, and 15% reading exam, to the same format but converting the two reading exams into Notes Submission (Credit/No Credit). The way she structures the prompts is that there is no correct idea, as long as you are able to relate the core concepts and theories with the assigned readings. She genuinely wants her students to succeed. Lectures sparked in-class discussions that engaged everybody with the difficult concepts.",

Once you turn in the assignments you get the points no matter what. 75 points was from the assignments list, and another 25 is from an reflection essay, attendence, and a plan of what assignments you were going to do. She didn't tell people that attendence was being taken for credit, so not a lot of people showed up to lecture. So a lot of people lost points for no attendence. On another note, the class structure was constantly changing, so it was slightly confusing. This also means there is a good chance the class might be a bit different next quarter. ",

She's also very understanding and gives good feedback on homework. You get to choose which homework assignments you do and there are no finals or midterms. Her homework is also based on participation not actual content. If you actually follow directions, you'll get full credit. And as long as you do a decent amount of the homework or at least one's that are worth a lot of points and one of the graded essays, you'll get an A.",

He is very kind and caring, he tries his best to make the class easier on students, emphasizing how \"quizzes don't do much, but a research paper will help you in the real world.\" He teaches very interesting subjects, sometimes he talks a lot, and gives a lot of information. It is important to attend class but you don't need to write about every subject he talks about, though they are connected and will give you many ideas about what to write about. The TA I had was super helpful,  so I am not sure what it is like to take this course without a good TA. There is a lot of reading and writing, and the writing is pretty difficult, however, you just have to be organized and keep a good schedule and it should not be too hard to complete. Grade depends mostly on TA, professor is open to questions and likes to be challenged/ asked questions or when students bring up topics for discussion. ",

Registered bc I'm interested in insects and need 12 units but it became my least favorite class ever because of the professor. Lectures prerecorded and sucks the life out of me even at 1.5x speed.  He also grades based on bell curve, so that the 60-90 percentile students are in B range. Cool, right? No, not cool when you're at the 60% percentile with a 86% overall in class. Your grade heavily depends on how well your peers are doing. Rip gpa over some stupid grasshoppers. ",

The lectures are all over the place. There are no slides or lecture outlines, just him ranting about Chicano history and stuff. Also, he requires our camera to be on for attendance purposes, and most of us just woke up. The readings, though short, are shared through blurry jpgs, so they are tedious to read.   His assignments are film review essays. He makes us watch hour-long documentaries and write about it with a very vague prompt.  Honestly, I learned more from those documentaries than I ever did in his class. He also expects us to email him the assignments instead of having us submit them on ilearn. One of my assignments got lost in his spam folder! He takes his sweet-ass time grading assignments.The midterms and finals are just as bad as the assignments, except the TAs are grading them so each TA has their own guidelines. At least they are take-home. The timeline of this class is also very messed up. Our first assignment is assigned on week 5. Our midterm is on week 7, the same day a homework assignment is due.  Our last assignment is due the day of finals, and also can be submitted hours after the final is due.  This class would work much better asynchronous. Do yourself a favor. Do not take this class. Take a different ethnic studies class. Take Asian-American studies or African American Studies or religion.

All quizzes and exams were open note. Straightforward questions. Just make sure to know your stuff and stay on top of the material.

If possible take John as your TA, he's not only a great teacher but his questions are very fair and similar to Chrissanthos.

No exams; just two papers, lots of readings (which I will admit I forgot to do a lot of lol) and a big final project (in groups). Papers can be hard depending on how picky your TA is. If your TA is Clayton, then you're good to go, he's a super chill TA. The second paper was made optional and we got an extension on the final project due to #BLM. Highly recommend Eacott.

Most of your grade depends on the decade assignments, which are short 400+ word essays. The prompts were sometimes confusing, but it didn't take up that much of my time to write. There were 4 of these assignments and it is graded by your TA, so you grade kinda depends on how nice they are and if you basically follow the rubric, it shouldn't be too hard to do well on these essays. Apparently, there was supposed to be one decade assignment per week (pre-COVID), but she changed to biweekly assignments to make it easier for students in the pandemic. She also made the final optional for us. It was a relatively easy A class for most people as long as you complete all the assignments, come to discussion, and do all the extra credit quizzes.",

If you took Calc AB in hs, this is mainly a review w a few new tricks on familiar concepts. Homework is weekly and kind of a bother bc the system can be picky about \"correct\" answers. For instance, it often does not recognize answers that are equivalent to its own so you kind of have to solve problems very formally. Weekly quizzes in discussion, but the TAs do a great job of walking you through the concept and then quizzing you at the end of discussion. Tests aren't too bad",

The homework problems are more complex than those on the exams which I think is good because you will be prepared for the exams. The averages were about 80-85%. The midterms (2) and final are all free-response and must be worked out and turned in via Gradescope. As far as proctoring, he required us to log into zoom and have our cameras on and no calculators allowed. He also did offer one extra credit quiz. DOWNSIDE: He only uploads his notes that he takes during the live lecture but does not record the actual lecturing. However, he does upload example videos of him going through various problems for the modules.",

So try to get him if you take this course :) In terms of content, if you're a freshman and you didn't take any AP Calc courses but placed into this, its definitely gonna be overwhelming. There's always gonna be kids who know more than you since they had more experience with it. You can do well even if you procrastinate but beware that it's a LOT of cramming. Make sure you study for the quizzes because it's easy to forget considering how much we have to remember. Be attentive during lecture, you miss one thing and can get lost and then needa rewatch it. Also, he monitors the chat so you don't have to speak to participate. Overall, a rigorous course but he's a really good professor so you'll be in good hands :)",

I crammed the exams bc i had other difficult classes to cater to, but I'd like to say i did fine. Just make sure you do the practice problems and try to not let this class sit on the backburner like i did. study frequently, bc a lot of this class is very new in terms of notation. its like learning another language kinda. a bunch of proofs too. however, once you get that down its pretty straightforward",

TA carried the course, but he doesn't really care about his students. Very inaccessible.  ",

Huge help if you take PHYS040B concurrently (a lot of the topics align such as buoyant forces, and efficiency).\n\nWhat helped me the most to get an A is having access to 100% correct answers from Chegg or solution keys from previous years. Having accurate solutions helped in two ways: one, saved my homework grade and, two, gave me the right answers to study from when it came to the exam time. Midterm 1, 4/5 problems were seen previously in either homework or quizzes. Midterm 2, 3/5 problems were seen already. Go to office hours to check if your solutions are 100% correct, so you don't miss any points on the exam. Outside of his lectures, you should start applying the principles in the real world and think, \"what are the forces acting on this system?\" or \"Why does this work/built this way?\". Ultimately this class should start to make you think like an engineer. Keep in mind this class is supposed to be somewhat enjoyable, and stay humble because it only gets harder from here.",

And it's pretty easy to mess up since some questions are based on memory of what an artist looks like or a certain part of a song out of a required 30 songs that are required.

There is a test every week so go to office hours every week because everything is built ontop of everything so if you dont understand something from a previous week it will harm you the entire quarter.

He's also pretty funny in the slack channel. One girl was like, \"Where is the 10th assignment?\" when we only had two essays, and he was like \"you're scaring people\" LOL.

Dr. Wood is super sweet and his lectures (if you do decide to go) are essentially a discussion about the assigned readings. If you choose not to go, he offers recorded lectures and notes as supplements.  Homework are the assigned readings but you don't really need to read any of them unless you're choosing that specific one to write the essay about. No exams only four essays two of which are mandatory; the first one is a practice one and the last one is an extra credit opportunity. Each essay increases in page limit; the first one 1-2, second 2-3, etc. Essays are super easy and basically an analysis essay on the argument of the document. TAs grade the essays so it really depends on them. I had Gustavo for my discussion and he was pretty easy going, attending was also not mandatory. The only assignment was a discussion question regarding the material due every Wednesday and in the discussion he'd address those questions.",

His midterm is very similar to his practice exams and homework is difficult so if you struggle with that don't worry to much just make sure to understand the practice exams and concepts. Final is NOT cumulative so that helps too. Does online clickers for credit so class is kinda mandatory and I never read his reading notes before lecture, but doing that would've helped me .\nPHYS 2A is known as a weeder class, but I learned a lot and walked out with a B+ because of Prof Ellison so definitely take it with him!\"",

Quite a few problems were similar to practice exams and it was not difficult to do well in the class as long as you know how to do practice exam questions and the lecture examples. A lot of it is just knowing how to use the formulas/equations, so sometimes just knowing how to do math can help you solve the problems! Since the exams are on the easier side, he doesn't curve much so 90 = A, 75 = B, and 60 = C, but if averages are low, he may change the cutoffs slightly. The professor you take for physics in general will determine how well you do since some professors give more difficult exams, but will curve or adjust cutoffs accordingly.",

The midterm was fairly simple, as it only covered about three chapters, but the final will definitely kill everyone's grade (however, it is not cumulative).\nDiscussions are mandatory and there was a quiz every class -- something not mentioned in the syllabus. According to my TA, 50% of one's discussion grade is based off attendance and the other 50% is based off the quiz grades.\nClickers were not based off participation -- something that is different from 40A.

For example this quarter(winter 2018) he somehow combined pistons, ideal gases, heat of vaporization, and thermodynamics into a single fucking question. Even if you understand the physics behind all these concepts perfectly, his questions feel like a puzzle. As far as I can tell, the other two professors make extremely \"easy\" straightforward questions and the curve is usually pretty nice. \n\nIn the past, you would want to avoid Mills because he makes the hardest questions and he doesn't teach that well but now that all the professors are making the final, it might actually be beneficial to have him as a professor because you could get used to his madness before the final.

She gives no midterm as well, only the final, and there are weekly assignments as well as a final project. On another note, she requires 4 hours of \"research participation\", which is done online. The research consists mostly of taking online quizzes that are used in UCR studies and each one is worth an hour, so do 4 quizzes on the UCR research site for easy completion. ",

Lectures were asynchronous for the quarter I took it but honestly most of us only watched like 1 or 2 lectures and did fine, especially because it was all open-note/open book. No homework. Just some short multiple choice tests (20 questions) every so often, and the lowest one is dropped for your final grade. The topic is kind of interesting too. Highly recommend",

I got a B, and I read every chapter and attended all the lectures. She is funny AF, so thats always a positive of attending lecture. Does not post lecture slides, but can get them if you make friends. Otherwise a good and insightful class to take, but reading is required for a good grade.",

Typos and confusing questions were a regular occurrence in his midterm and final. Hard final and it was 45% of grade while midterm was 40%. Anyone saying it was easy or a good class is a liar.

I knew NO spanish and can actually understand it very well. Shes always open to giving feedback on homework and compositions so never hesitate to ask if you want that perfect score on your homework. Honestly  wish I could take her for spanish 2 because she ultimately wanted us to have a good understanding of spanish. Lots of class and homework though but pretty easy! ",

Overall the grading is harsh but he does try to make it easy for us to understand. He\u2019s very helpful when it comes to addressing questions or homework. You have to actively participate during Zoom and turn on your camera. He takes attendance. The class consists of using McGraw broken down into 8 sections and everyday (Mon-Thur) the assignment deadline is due the next day before class starts instead of 11:59pm. There\u2019s also chapter quizzes based on the homework and textbook. Two writing compositions during class time. Midterm is an individual oral presentation. I feel like this class was way easier than high school but I tend to forget everything so it was basically a review course but also relearning what I forgot. He wasn\u2019t mean or rude like I hear about the other Spanish professors. The class was chill. Take him if you can! If you know more on speaking Spanish then this class would be easy for you. ",

Class has 2 written exams, 5 textbook assignments and quizzes, 2 oral presentations (one for the midterm and one for the final), and a final written exam. However, the textbook assignments/quizzes are 30% of your grade, so do good on those and try to get B's on the other assignments. Be prepared because the quizzes can take a while to complete because of how lengthy the questions are. Plus the textbook was online and terrible (not to mention it was 50 bucks).",

The online textbook is very specific about what kinds of answers it accepts, so be prepared to go into Office Hours often to fight to get points back. Pretty much daily homework assignments (30 minutes max), 2 short essays, 4 quizzes, two oral assessments (1 presentation, and 1 conversation), and then an online final in the same format as the quizzes/homework. Sounds like a lot, but it is spaced out nicely over the 10 weeks. For my class, cameras were required to be on, which made the class really enjoyable! Nice to interact with people. ",

The HW's are insanely long to do and all pretty much word problems so if you hated those well here they are to fuck you one last time before you graduate. The biggest helpful advice I can give you is to recognize what type of question each problem is asking you and to do each HW before the Quizzes.\n\nThe Quizzes themselves are the HW so if you do them before they are due you'll have a fighting chance. A lot of people didn't pick this up until too late. Every discussion ends with a quizz and yeah you get a quizz and HW literally a day before the final. Jill has no mercy.\n\nAll in all if you can get 90% and above on the HW's and Quizzes you may just pass this class but it won't be an easy task. THE HW IS HARD. This is a heavy class to balance and if you don't put time and effort into this class you'll definitely repeat it. ",

He is funny, grades easily as long as you put in some effort for your acting, and practically gives you an \"A\" if you show up to the lecture (participation counts). There is no h.w. for this class. He occasionally gives small quizzes on the plays/screen writes (which can be found online) and write a short review for a play. The final is also super easy (it's a 3-5 min group performance, you get full points for participation).",

Lecture, discussion and screening. Screening is one movie per week. Some basic projects but not too much of a time commitment to them to be honest. I just make sure to show up (attendence) and turn in assignments and it'll be pretty difficult to not pass the class. Midterm from the textbook, short answer form. No final, just final project 5-7ish page outline of script.",
