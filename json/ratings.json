No homework, gave out extra credit which was to go to a museum and answer the questions, she gives out pop quizzes which are short answer(about 3-4 questions), midterm was short answer questions and a page front and back of multiple choice (midterm is easy only if you study) gotta rememeber the images she shows, final is online and she posts questions all you gotta do is answer each question using key terms and at least a page each. legit all her quizzes and tests are all on the lecture so just show up to class. sounds like a lot but its really not. good luck.

She also rambles a bit so you have to really pay attention or ask specific questions. The material isn't really difficult to understand, it's just that whatever she says in lecture is so niche that you have to be present. Our midterm was assigned over three days, and it was THREE five page essays regarding images on slides that gave no further information than who painted it in what year. And on top of that two weeks later we have another five page essay due that isn't even a final.",

You need to sign up on a website to get your participation grade which is only 3 lectures but you don't actually have to participate. Lecture isn't mandatory only the 3 days you sign up. There are 1-2 paragraph unit responses which weren't even that bad and are due every 2 or 3 weeks I believe. 1 midterm, 1 paper and a final. Midterm consists of 3 questions 5 pages in length and she only gives you about a week to complete. Final is the same format. If you don't like writing, then I wouldn't recommend this class. ",

In short, doing the readings, they're pretty important. Her TAs can be strict or lenient, pray on that, as they grade your 3 essays. McMullin is very much lenient herself, she gave us an extra credit opportunity for 30 free points on our 200 point midterm and even gave us the final's essay questions as take home. \n\nTLDR: Easy class, IF you do the readings.

The class is split into the lecture portion, and the discussion portion. In discussion, you will research an archaeological site (Giza, Technotitlan, etc...) and give an oral presentation, write a group paper on the site, and an individual paper about one certain aspect of the site (indigineous people, religion, tourism etc). This is worth ~50% of your grade. The other half is the lecture portion. I personally did not care at all for the material presented. It was all dates and sites of importance cause they found evidence of fire here or whatever. Very uninteresting stuff. One midterm, one final. The average the midterm was a C, i believe. Shows how much everyone didn't understand what was going on. The average on the final i believe wasn't much better. I ended up with a C- in the clAss, which I'm honestly ok with. Difficult class, imo. Take cultural anthropology. I've heard its easy. Definitely easier that world pre history lol",

The quizzes are very straightforward and short, the exams are exactly what he describes them to be. My TA Johanna Najera was also super nice and she is very knowledgable on the topics that we learn.

Midterm was MC, free response, and an essay question. A big chunk of our points came from that but it's super doable. There is a LOT of reading, but you don't need to read everything to do well. The paper covered health and healing techniques used by certain groups of people (ex: Shamanism). It was a group paper; each person wrote about 500 words to make a 2,000 word paper. Very easy class and interesting class. HOWEVER, this does not count for anthropology credit; it will count as an elective course.

Graded for attendance to discussion section. Lectures are a bit useless since he reads straight from the slide show, but he grades for attendance. before the midterm you can get away with not doing the readings since there are only 2-3 questions about the readings in the midterm, but after the midterm he starts to heavily rely on the readings in the weekly responses.

She does a quiz every Friday to test your knowledge. There are no midterms or final, just 10 of the Friday quizzes. There are also in class labs that you work on every class. Not too complicated or long and she is more than willing to go through it step by step if you ask. There is no set due date for any of the labs - just get them in when you finish. Slides for lecture at posted on elearn and the book is available on Amazon. She\u2019s a pretty nice teacher and is no too harsh of a grader. No sure if it will continue but this quarter they are testing out giving students full skeletons to take home to study with - personally never took it out of the box. ",

When you register, it shows the class and studio time. It's one after the other, so you're there for nearly 3 hours. Don't get discouraged by the time, it's necessary to have a long class for art because of the activities you're doing and sometimes there will be critiques - where everyone goes around to talk about what they liked about the drawing and what could be improved/done differently. Attendance is mandatory, if you miss one class you can miss out on a lot if it was on a critique day. Your homework is 3 large drawings each week, and she gives you a theme for the drawings, it's all still life for the most part. This class does require you to buy art supplies.",

Art is a subjective course so you can pretty much do whatever you want in this class (as long as it pertains to the theme). Every week there's a new theme (figure, landscape, still life, etc.) and you just need to paint things based on that theme. The materials can get really pricey but Gerald was pretty lenient with whatever material you use. The online class was set up with you logging on and following Gerald's painting examples but there were also times where you explain your painting process and thoughts when you showcase and review your pieces in class. If you want an easy course without minding spending somewhere between $50-$100+ on materials then go for this class. ",

There are 3 reading - 2 require write ups- and each project requires a project statement. Also different from the name you are not working with clay or ceramics.

Points system (total 400 points). 150 (2 midterms), 80 (9 weekly homework, drops the lowest), 70 (weekly quizzes, drops lowest), 100 points (final exam) \n\nProfessor Dingwall is amazing. Great lecture and teaching style. Taught this class like it was a story and used real life examples in every lecture. There was a logical and reasonable order to the topics we were learning. Lectures were very enjoyable and entertaining. She uploads lecture slides a week in advance, but I didn't need to look at them beforehand or studying anything before. I just showed up to class and did all the studying after. The exams were fair. Exam viewing and not giving back tests was a new concept to me. I understand the premise, but it did make studying for future exams different and more difficult as I wasn't able to go back and see how she likes to structure her exams. But, I don't disagree or believe it drastically affected my grades and how I study/learn. The lecture slides are very helpful as well as her summary outlines. I especially like the templates she provided and how she drew them in class with us. The most important study tool I utilized in this class was rewatching the lectures through Yuja. I did not do this for every single lecture, only the ones where we were filling in our templates. It was vital for me to be able to go back and look back at the videos as she does not post a completed version of her notes. Her office hours were helpful as well. She was very approachable and encouraging towards me as a student. Content was very dense for this class, but it was as expected. I like how we had homework every week as it kept me on top of my studies as well as the weekly quizzes. It helps cushion my grade in the class so it is not only the midterms and finals that compose of my final grade. Thank you Dr. Dingwall.",

At around week 8, there would be demos/presentations to show that your device could complete at least one (+points if <1) functionality, and you could explain to the rest of the class why this functionality is important/significant. There are also biweekly progress meetings with TAs you have to schedule in your own time, to update them on how far your device has gotten with progress.",

I actually really enjoyed it, most of my friends didn't attend lecture if it was their first class and still got A's (I got an A-). One thing to watch out for is he will try to trick you on the midterms (all multiple choice): you will read the question, immediately know the answer, and when you get the midterm back realize you read it wrong! Be sure to read each midterm question carefully, and if you are choosing \"the obvious answer\" read the question and think of the concept carefully. Beyond that, he is hilarious, the videos are hilarious, but the lecture/OH is a bit boring (he repeats himself... a lot). Still, most I know really struggle with Bio 5A, Maduro knows this and tries to give us as much help as possible without throwing A's at us. He'll give you every exam he's ever written (some going back to 2006 I think?), do them all! Oh, and a pro-tip I wish I discovered sooner: the video have a \"view captions\" tab, and most of the quiz questions (which halt the video) are discussed right after in the script, so you can look there \"to confirm your answer\".",

I would recommend go over the practice exam qs, attend his office hours where he'll do more practice exam qs, go to SI, attend TA's office hours, and simplify lecture materials/concept for easy memorization. He also do extra credits (10 points max) that'll make a huge difference for your grades where you ask him a question in lecture and he'll give you extra credit slip (earn only one per lecture). Overall course is based on 2 midterms, weekly discussion quizzes and hw, and 1 final. There's grade cut-off where getting 80% out of total will be considered as A-.

Its very informational but not done in a logical order that makes it easier to learn, you'll realize that when you go back and review your notes. Other than that the class is memorization and application based. There was 2 midterms and a final exam. She also did in class activities that you must be there for, but you could turn it in with the wrong answer and correct it later for more points. Lowest quiz dropped and lowest in class activity dropped. She also offers a few extra credit points here and there.",

The prelab quiz are really easy and a quick skim though the lab manual you can get full credit on those quizzes. For the 3 major quizzes thought the quarter, really focus on the results and the procedures and look over the worksheets and you will be good. This quarter (Fall 2019) I thought the lab final was cake, as it was just all the worksheets and the practice exam that were on the exam, but do study if you want high grade. I think they might've change the 5LA final because people previous quarters told me it was very difficult and stuff on it wasn't learned, but that wasn't the case this quarter.",

It depends, but you have to draw diagrams of lab experiment's procedures as pre-labs. There's some point where you have to do exactly as the procedure tells you to not screw up, and there's some cases where you might have to re-do the lab experiment in case of mishaps. In addition, sometimes the TA grading are weird/ a bit harsh as they mark off points for some worksheet qs that are wrong despite your answers are correct but looks wrong. So, re-read the lab manual and make sure that you can find the answer of the worksheet qs from the lab manual. Midterm and Final are mostly conceptual from what you are learning while doing the labs, not based on procedures of the lab. Lastly, 1 group project at the end of the quarter based on fish frauds through DNA labs. ",

He also post study questions for each lecture that are crucial for doing good on the test.

He does recorded lectures with set of notes and holds live office hours. The videos can be long and kind of boring because of his monotone voice. I recommend you read the notes before you start the videos, that way you learn and retain more during the videos. There are 2 noncumulative midterms, 3 noncumulative quizzes, and 1 cumulative final. Please take this class seriously and study at least one week before each exam or quiz. Dr. Kelly did a great job of providing \"What you need to know\" slides at the end of each lecture so that you can really pinpoint what to study. There is NO CURVE and NO EC. I also recommend doing well on the very first midterm as that will set the stage and also get 100% on your lab portion as that is 25% of your final grade and can really give you that boost.

DO NOT take this class with Ring Carde because when I had him as a professor, the entire class panicked for the final. \n\n- He is a boomer when it comes to technology (he posted 3 hours videos because he forgot to stop the recording after the first hour, and would make an announcement to the class saying \"I dont know why this upload is taking forever\" yeah well its because you forgot to record so the file is massive). His final also showed the answers early, so if you were on the phone with someone else while taking the exam and one person turns it in, they can tell you what is correct and incorrect which I think everyone didn't expect.\n- His videos were boring and the slides were poorly made (you would see text boxes all over the place)\n- He was supposed to be giving out quizzes but completely ignored the syllabus, other professor (Larry Li) had to take care of that mess\n- His final exam was completely incorrect on more than several questions. The slide had WORD FOR WORD the opposite statement to the answer on the exam which he did not correct. He actually only corrected one single question...\n- When we emailed him about the final, he didn't respond to a single email (everyone was talking to each other at this point).\n\nI don't doubt he's a passionate guy nor do I think he's a bad person. But when he taught BIOL005C for me in Fall 2020, he was the worst professor I have ever had (and I'm about to graduate as I write this, no one was worse than him). Please drop that class IMMEDIATELY if you see him teaching BIOL005C (maybe other subjects he's fine, and not online). You will not get a good experience.",

Her exams weren't too bad if you studied but she would throw in a few curveballs. 107A isn't that hard but there is a lot to know, so if you study regularly then you'll be fine. I would study only two days in advance for exams and walked out w a B+ after her small curve. Recommend taking someone else tho",

The answers on the tests had like 10 answers all very similar too so you would have to know your shit. we had very little time for exams and no backtracking so most of the class didn't finish a couple questions but he's so stuck on not being able to collaborate/cheat he will not adjust this method.

They provide a transcript along with each slide for convenience. Most content is pretty simple to understand. 45% of the grade consists of discussion attendance, quizzes (unlimited attempts), and discussion assignments which are all free points. Each midterm is worth 15% and the final is cumulative and worth 25%. Some of the exam questions are kind of detailed and requires you kinda dig through the lecture notes, but she said she does that since the exam is already open note, so you kinda got to be careful when reading the questions and referencing your notes. Each midterm has 25 questions in 50 minutes, so relying solely on digging through your notes may take up too much time. Averages were typically high, so no curve was needed. The final felt easier than the midterms and had the highest average.",

His midterms consist of free response and multiple choice, let's just say he is the harshest free response graders on the planet. The TA was horrible, could not speak english clearly at all (not to sound racist or anything). She tries to answer your questions but she never does a good job and you just end up more confused than ever. Both of their office hours are at unreasonable times and the day the week I was able to go to office hours, the TA on Monday announces that she will have her office hours on Tuesday. Like how unorganized can that be!! I dropped this class week 7 in the winter quarter, although I could not see if he did not curve or not, but I don't think that he will.

The TAs only gave verbal guidelines to it in discussion and didn't seem in consensus with even the prof about certain things.  Don't know why they didn't give us the breakdown in the first place so we would know exactly what to include.

Just memorize your life cycles and his slides, and you'll be chilling for a half of the midterms. The second half of the midterms are based on research papers he picks himself based on parasites studied in class. They are quite hard to read but actually give you a good scope of what most modern scientists do and is a quite different change of learning in college. Definitely would help prepare students for the MCAT especially because sections like bio/biochem require being comfortable with reading passages that are excerpts from primary research articles. The only problem with this class in my opinion is the research project that you have to analyze a research paper of your choice on a parasite you pick and dumb it down for 5th graders. Pretty pointless, but thats my only complaint.",

You do need to know the hormone cycles and basic info on her slides, so draw them out couple days before exam and doing her practice exams helped. Prof. Wendy is really nice and she is very understanding in these COVID times. I got average all both midterms and 100% in discussion and the annotated bibliography and walked out with a B- so I'd say that's fair. Get a good TA that will definitely boost your grade at the end.

It takes a lot of effort to study for the midterms which is a large chunk of your grade (25% for each three) because of the amount of content. If you start studying for each exam early via quizlet or your own flashcards, you are guaranteed a B. Lectures are in the morning, but going helps as the professor gives mystery questions that are on the exam and lectures help with memorizing exam content. Also, many questions that are on the exam are homework questions so look out for those! Would recommend, just make sure you have the time for it. ",

The prof doesn't really teach - he just shows you how to do textbook problems without explaining anything. He assigned us weekly quizzes, but I didn't find them that useful. They only showed us what types of questions he was going to give us on the exams. He also didn't give us a practice midterm or final which I thought was inconsiderate, considering we were online and he wasn't that good of a professor. The TAs were also barely useful. They would just upload videos explaining the answers to quizzes, but those explanations weren't that good in my opinion. I think that this class was manageable, but not a good experience. ",

During lectures he would read off slides and ramble incoherently. Despite the HUGE curve on the midterm someone received a 9.0 out of 100. 9 POINTS!!!!!! That is fucking insane. Safe to say Samuelson is a complete imbecile. DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE TAKE BUS020 WITH SAMUELSON. Unless you took accounting in highschool or are a fucking aerospace engineer this course will not be fun. We also had to pay $130 to pay for textbook/hw program. Now I am down $130 and my gpa is completely tanked.",

For the most part, things made sense in the first half of the quarter, but afterwards I was pretty confused on what was going on. Lectures aren't the most helpful, so you end up having to do self-teaching and the discussion homework you have to do every week isn't the most helpful after the midterm. The midterm actually wasn't terribly difficult which is good because you have to get a good grade on the midterm if you want to pass this class because the final is really hard. To give you an idea of how hard the final is, this quarter the average was less than 50%. My advice is to avoid taking this class with Samuelson, but if you're left with no other choice; make sure read through the textbook, make some friends you can study with (or join some a discord for the class), and if you're doing a homework question and can't figure it out, try pasting the question into google (you won't actually get the answer but you'll usually see people who have posted partially correct answers on chegg and you can use that as help on how to solve the question).

The first midterm is really easy because it's all lecture-based but the final is a timed write and basically feels kind of like an AP Lang/Lit timed write.\nThere are around 4 essays total.

There were also labs were it was mostly coding. The first two weeks of class your going to learn Java script and the rest of the class was mostly on python. Literally by the end of the quarter the professor emailed the whole class that people were cheating on the first two project and there was a person who got caught cheating on the second project but they never cheated on anything as every other student got good grades for their codes even if they cheated. For some reason they think the professor sees their code and compares it to everyone else and just says that they\u2019re cheating when they\u2019re literally knowing what it\u2019s code does and how it works and still ended up getting written up to the academic integrity department where everyone else is free. And this was like one of those public sights to deal with python codes where the public can see your codes and you can\u2019t do anything about unless you pay for it\u2019s services to make your code private. Once you meet with the integrity office person and said what you did and how it came to this then once they meet with your professor they\u2019ll say the opposite of what you said and what you did wrong then your getting the blame for cheating. If you\u2019re going to take this class just be careful about your codes and hope there isn\u2019t any relations to other students code or else you\u2019ll probably get an email saying you\u2019ve cheated an assignment.  Also if you\u2019ve got written up for academic dishonesty for some reason after your case has been dealt with, you\u2019re not able to email the professor and saying that they\u2019ll change your grade for us and would say that who ever is the person you\u2019ve been dealing with the case their just going to say the professor has to change the grade for you and you\u2019ll won\u2019t know how to be in contact with the professor because they\u2019ll just ignore the email about this. This class shouldn\u2019t be too difficult unless you know how to do code but they gave it a 10 due to this experience being that they know how to code and everything for some reason the professor just accused them for cheating when they weren\u2019t. Students shouldn\u2019t go to UCR because most facilities are just finding new ways to get money and when you realized during the orientation it was mostly that the school wanted more money and that\u2019s why the school accepted more students due because once there were more students equals more money to the school it really sounds like this is a corrupted system.

Attendance isn't mandatory for discussion or lecture but I would recommend going to lecture on the coding days especially if you don't know coding well. There are 3 projects, and project 1 and 3 are group ones while the 2nd project is individual only. You can also do all projects individually as well. They are pretty time consuming, but they aren't terrible if you put the effort in. For project 2, you can not use chatgpt and they will know if you did, so don't use it.

The worst part of the class is that it's at 7:30 AM, so he knows that a lot of people aren't going to attend lecture. Honestly, he's a cool dude and pretty funny at times, but he can be THAT professor that takes attendance when he sees that people aren't showing up. There are weekly reading assignments that you have to write in 10 pt font single space. You get used to it and it really doesn't seem that bad when writing - the reading part is what takes a lot. In the syllabus there's a format for all the readings, so make sure you answer the questions, using the key words of the format. The TAs are going to receive hundreds of 3 pages of 10 pt font single space assignments, they're not going to read it word for word. For the midterms (2 separate days of 2 questions out of 4, so one day one question, the other day another), Jasso is going to choose it by random. He crumbles up papers with the question numbers on them, makes students switch it around, and reveals it in front of the class. With all this entertainment, the midterm and the final (that's during week 10, but choosing 2 out of 5 questions) only allow for 30 minutes of writing time. On the exams, he does say to reference lecture for some of them. It's hard to go to this class with it being so early in the morning, but hopefully you all have the drive to do it. If you do end up not going to class, try your best for the ones before the midterms and finals. He might talk about it. If this is one of the first core classes you take, brace yourself for another Jasso class with the same format (BUS103).",

We had a total of 7 homework assignments on Webassign, but one wasn't mandatory and another got dropped at the end of the quarter after 70% of the class did course evaluations. Two exams total, each with a few bonus questions meaning it was possible to get over 100%, although I'm not sure if anyone ever did. Really, I think the reason many find this class hard is that early on they overcomplicate it. Most of the class is just algebra, and they sooner you realize that the easier it becomes, in my opinion.",

Quizzes were multiple choice and short answer, but were hard because the TAs were harsh graders. In fact, there was some grading discrepancy since one TA graded easier than other TAs. The prof. posts lectures on iLearn but you should still go anyway. One group project presentation and term paper assigned too. Discussion was useless imo but go for attendance. You don't need the textbook for this class but buy it if you don't understand the class material. Overall, not easy to get an A in this class. ",

He gives you a template in PDF form so you can't copy and paste it onto Excel, but you have an idea of what you have to do.

                "comment": "[COVID-19] I took this class with Ye Li and it was honestly a really good class. At first, it was annoying that he sends out about 5 emails reminding you to do the web assignment before the first lecture (basically a ~15 minute survey for every class that relates to the lesson - he collects the students' stats to present in class). The professor is pretty lenient with the web assignments being submitted a little bit late, but that's not the case for the write ups. In the class besides the web assignments, there are 5 write-ups (with assigned readings ranging from like 5 to 15 pages, a big one being 30ish) in total that you need to do out of 8 offered in 10 weeks. The first two write ups (counted as 1) is with a randomly assigned group and was 600 words each. The rest, you are free to chose as long as you have done 5. There's no midterm and only a final - the final you have the option to go solo or choose a partner/have the professor choose one for you. The final is about a case study with 6 questions and all he tells you is that you have to use class concepts for it. You have 5 days to complete it and it had a word limit of 2000. The professor is great, he makes every topic interesting and has a lot of opportunities for extra credit throughout the quarter. Should basically be a pretty easy A class as long as you make the effort to do the web assignments and write ups. They're due every Thursday but if you turn it in the Sunday before, you get an extra credit point added to your score. I'd really recommend this class as an elective! My concentration is IS and this was definitely one of the easier classes I've taken and it was genuinely a good class. ",

The book is not required, you just need to purchase an access code for BUS 165 series, this code will be used for the entire series (A-C). Attendance is mandated and points are deducted for every lecture missed. There's a total of 20 points, miss 10 lectures, you receive no participation points when calculating grades. The course is challenging, yes, however, study well and try to achieve the highest possible score possible on each assignment (homework, pre-lecture quizzes, tests, etc.). You will need to keep track of the assignments due after and before each week as he does not remind you, and it's a lot of assignments if you don't keep up. The class is graded based upon the weighted grade or total points achieved, whichever one is higher. This is a class where if you don't put in work, you will fail, even if the professor says \"85% of the class will get a B- or higher\". Exams will have questions from the CPA exam. Overall, if you think accounting upper divs is an easy A, this major/concentration is not for you. ",

Reading the content on your own is more amusing than focusing on his words. For those who like structured lectures... you better make your own structure because this professor is like your grandparents where they tell you a narrative and somehow, we get too deep into one idea that is not relevant to the exams. Overall, it's disorganized learning.\n\nContents in exams/quizzes: Based on another student who only listened to lectures, he has a >90% on Midterm; another one who focused more on the notes has around 80-90%. Open note. Half/half context or terminology, the other is calculation and reading graphs/charts\n\nTAs: they're straight-forward and their content is more informative.\n\nTips for survival:\n-When studying for this course, organize your notes by the following: \n1.) what/how/why of each article he's discussing\n2.) Terminology and the general concepts of a specific structure\n3.) Formulas and graphs/charts that he's referencing about.\n4.) Actually practice math, because this man barely reviews about it and it's 1/4 on the Midterm\n\nAvoid if:\n1.) Planning on missing lectures\n2.) Lacking in auditory learning \n3.) Cannot tolerate monotoned voice or long pauses\n\nOpinion: As a student with ADHD and currently on meds at its peak while taking his lecture, I was very surprised he was able to disengage my interest in paying attention to class. This class is narrative based and contains a lot of reading without clear guidance on what to actually study. If you find yourself getting frustrated with him, just remember that he's willing to teach you if you ask and that he's just a human being with feelings.",

Has a thick accent but sets up the class in a way that makes it super difficult to fail (you seriously need to not do anything to not get points). He has a redemption system so you can get points back if your final exam grade is much higher than your midterm exam scores. All of his exams have extra credit problems that he will give you to do before the exam day (yay!), but he has no curve. So scores on the exams depend entirely up to you. Homework is an easy 100% as long as you do it before the deadline and gives you unlimited attempts and no score penalties (unlike other professors that I have known). ",

He was ok, not terrible (though many others would say he was), but if you have the option to avoid him, I would. But if you do end up with him, it's not really a big deal, just try to adjust around his personality, I guess. He's also extremely conceptual, and his exams heavily reflect that  (hence, the difficulty), so you have to make sure you 110% understand concepts and how to apply that. If you only understand the concepts on a surface level, you won't do so hot on the tests. Also, homework is optional and not graded, so really try to understand literally everything on it if you want to ace the exams.",

It's a great transition from high school chemistry to college chemistry(especially if you took AP chem in HS). He's a pretty good prof and very kind and helpful. Midterm 1 was not too bad but he made midterm 2 harder on purpose to get the average score lower, but he does curve based on that. Midterm average is usually in the C range but it will be curved to a B- which is pretty generous. Go to lecture because he explains concepts that will be on the exam very well and does virtual clicker questions that you have to do bc they count towards your grade. The only concept he was kinda bad at teaching was hybridization so I'd recommend going to SI sessions for that. Overall, if you put in the work and don't slack off you'll be fine.",

His lectures are kinda broad and not very informative as he recommends you to go over the lectures slides that he already provided before coming to lecture. He does a couple of clicker questions per lecture based on the lecture slides which could be tricky if you weren't paying attention to the lecture slides. He's generous on clicker questions where everybody gets full credit if 80% of the entire class got the question correct, and few extra credit questions on the practice exams that you can check answers with him through email so that you'll already know the answer to them during the exam day. His exams are almost similar to the practice exams, but he might add few trick questions that are specific enough that they might catch you if you don't pay attention on lectures and practice exams. Knowing the answer choices on the practice exams can also help you as well so that you'll know when the answer choices will be correct on the real exam questions with different wording. He only curves based on how many points between the student with the highest score to reach the perfect score which isn't that much. Since this is a fast-paced course, it's recommended that you try master your understanding on certain chapters/concepts within a few days before the exam so that you'll have enough prep to do well on the actual exam. If you don't understand his lectures very well, always seek outside resources like SI, textbook, youtube vids, etc. TAs might be helpful depending on how informative/strict they are. If you can't handle the fast-paced course, it's best to wait until next year unless it's mandatory to catch up your 4-year graduating plan. ",

He posts recordings but doesn't use slides for some chapters. Grading scale was 2 midterms worth 30%, final worth 40%, and optional discussion quiz for up to 10% extra credit. Midterms are group midterms and open everything, final is in person and no notes allowed. Lectures and course outline are confusing to follow and midterm/exam problems are way harder than the material in class. TAs help a lot and you can go to any TA's office hours, sergio and Anton helped me a lot. I ended up with around an A in the class, but I had to actively study and put in a lot of effort. ",

There is extra credit in this class. His OLI homework and textbook system is very informative and I learned more chem than I needed to for this class which could be useful for chem1b.

There is no flow to his lectures and often you are wondering where this is going. My guy just lectures from the comfort of his own BED where he wears only boxers and an dirty undershirt. His conduct is completely disgraceful as an middle-aged adult man.\n\nSelf-studying is key. Your TA will definitely be useful since they feel sympathy for you. One of the TAs when I took the class was practically teaching the class when Lavallo should be doing his job. This TA was a lifesaver.\n\n\nThe class is test-heavy so do what you can to pass the tests. Final is weighted heavy as a percentage of the grade. \n\nDo very good on the extra-credit quizzes in discussion. You need the extra credit to not fail the class.\n\nThe only reason why the curve is good because of students over the years complaining about how the class sucks.",

One important thing, make sure to go to his revision sessions! You can miss his lectures (make sure to have a pal to tell you when to do polleverywhere) since he's going to give lecture slides anyway, but DO NOT miss his revision sessions, especially the ones right before final - he would give out extra credit answers for free (make a educated guess and ask him if you're right) the 15 points can buff your grade by 1.5% for free, good deal. If you have anything you don't understand, just ask him. Homework questions, the midterm you didn't do well on, anything, he will help you. For anyone taking CHEM001 series, remember, you do not have to get all questions right in the tests to grant an A, you just need to be better than the others in the class.

Attending the Zoom lecture was recommended and he occasionally tossed in some clicker questions to reward those who actively attended. Chem 1B builds off of the information you learned in Chem 1A so it's good to brush up on some of those topics. Like others are saying, this class is a lot of equations and plugging and chugging. The word problems are tricky too. Each chapter was a new concept for me, so it took me a while (and a lot of Khan Academy...) to fully understand the concepts and how the equations worked. Reading the textbook is extremely helpful and he bases most of his exam questions off of what he teaches on the slides. Zhao presents his information pretty thoroughly and takes the time to help students who are stuck. This class moves fairly quickly, so understanding all of the concepts is vital to earning a good grade. Unfortunately, the exams are all closed book and proctored. Clicker questions (20%), discussion points (10%), and homework (20%) make up 50% of the grade (as well as potential bonus points). For us, the homework had unlimited tries and there was no penalty for wrong answers. There are 2 midterms (10% each) and a final (30%). The exams aren't curved (I think), but the final class grade is based on a curve. Overall, I enjoyed this class a lot and I recommend taking it with Zhao!",

Highly recommend not taking with Jiang if you don't already have experience with gen chem (ex: taking a year of chem in high school/ap chem) because he can tend to be very conceptual instead of mathematical (and the midterms are mathematical). The poll/clicker questions can be pretty difficult because he doesn't really teach them beforehand so you're kind of learning as you go. The homework can also be frustrating because in the later chapters he doesn't do a lot of practice problems that are similar to what's on the homework. The midterms are pretty ok as long as you review the quizzes, poll/clicker questions, and homework. Practice midterm was helpful too because he goes over it in class.

He also post lecture videos on canvas where you do them and there's also lecture video quizzes that's worth a lot of points like a video quiz question that's worth 5 points. Polleverywhere questions are based on the materials and lecture vids, so do the lecture vids first before going to in-person lectures. Discussions are mandatory where you have to attend all of them to get attendance points, but Discussion TAs are pretty helpful at covering materials from lectures, and materials that'll be on the exams. For exams, they're mostly average to some that are difficult due to being more of an applicable qs than conceptual qs along with calculation qs as well. There's also FRQs for the exam which is based on mostly calculations, drawing, and write to explain your answer. So, do the practice problems, asking qs to TA/Eicheler's office hours, form a study group, go to SI, etc. Overall course is 1 midterm, 1 midterm re-take, 1 final, lecture vids/lecture quizzes/qs, discussion attendance, and poll qs. Grading is based on points grade cut-offs, earn as many points as you can. Eichler also do some extra credit points from either completing his potential surveys, answering pizzara qs that students post, etc. ",

He's also quite helpful during office hours where he'll let you try answer the problems first, then he'll guide you the rest when you're unsure of solving your questions. Overall, he's a pretty nice and caring professor. If you want to succeed more, then do the optional textbook problems he will assigned which makes you more well-prepared, and/or get more supplementary instructions from the SI leaders which were also quite helpful to me for more understanding of what Casselman covered in lectures.

So, overall made my experiences in CHEM08LA a bit more lenient. For the materials/labs, it's very time consuming despite that it's not that difficult to them as there's multiple parts with repeated steps in certain labs. The very first wet lab made my lab went overboard on the timing since it took forever to obtain the necessary data. So, just plan ahead on what you will need to do and get started asap so that you don't have to wait in line to grab the necessary materials. In terms of the grading, it really depends on how well you do in the lab, the experiment data, and your understanding throughout the labs. So, just double check your understanding and lab report during any TA's office hours or by emailing for feedbacks/extra help.  The lab final were alright since it's based on the tophat qs and what you did throughout the previous labs along with calculation qs when doing reagent tables. Overall, the lab is quite average in terms of understanding the materials and the procedure you will be doing for each lab. ",

He cares a lot about his students, is extremely nice to everyone, and is always looking to improve or make changes to make the experience better for students. He always stays an extra hour or more during office hours and sometimes stays after lecture as well to answer questions. The content of this class is difficult and definitely requires a lot of studying, but his exams are fair. The problem sets are optional but definitely help a lot in preparing for exams. He grades fairly and he also allows regrades on Gradescope. He handwrites all his notes and they are really neat. Dr. Kou is probably one of the best professors at UCR and I highly recommend taking his class. He also bumps you up a grade letter if you are borderline. (I was ~1% away and he rounded up for me and I heard he rounded someone up 3% to the next grade letter, so he is very generous).",

You could tell that he genuinely cared about his students. Personally, I found the final to be the hardest, then the first midterm, and then the 2nd midterm. I would HIGHLY recommend going to SI as much as possible. I think that was the main thing that contributed to me getting an A in the class. He will also most likely assign problem sets throughout the chapter. I would also suggest keeping up with those, instead of saving them all for the week before the exam. The material in this course is inherently more difficult than that in CHEM008A, which is the only reason I would give it a relatively high difficulty score. ",

If you're adjusted to a different professor's teaching style from 8A (like Hooley with his cheat sheets) and you can take them again, I would recommend it. Same grading scale as Casselman, same \"I won't curve\" mentality. Our first exam was curved by 2% (down to the highest score since no one got 100). Otherwise, the other two exams were not individually curved. The all FRQ with no cheat sheet can be really difficult, lots of mechanisms to know for 8B. Kou takes the notes with you during class and will stop to write down important points, he really does want us to learn. Lots of problem set practice and go to OH/SI if you can. I scored around average on all my exams and got all my participation (poll ev) points, should've ended with a D+, but because of my average scores and full participation, he curved me to a C (without me even asking!!).

I worked super super hard to obtain an A+ in this class despite numerous hours just constantly studying ochem while disregarding studying physics and bio. This guy wants you to know everything from the textbook, including all rxns, mxns, and nomenclatures. Teaches unnecessary stuff as well from the textbook such as molecular orbitals and other non-important materials. His tests are really ambiguous that makes it hard to do. You're only to have one flash card cheat sheet per exam (even final with only one card), so write down all the info you need that can help you get through the exam. Sometimes, he gives an entire chemical structure and wants you to determine the rxn of it. Retro-synthesis, predict product, NMR, hydrolysis mxns, and other important mxns related to his 1066 lecture summary are a must to know and master asap. His true self are in disguise, so only act appropriately at proper time and words when you are interacting with him. To succeed, self-study is a must with the textbook problems, his practice exams, optional hw, reliance on TAs, ARC, and other outside sources. It's better off to self-study than just live by his lecture notes as the textbook and others were lot clear and straightforward to understand than his lecture notes. His curves were quite questionable, the average was around 30%-35%, but getting an A with 2 standard deviations above average were mostly around 50% and above. Overall, pls take other ochem professors other than Pirrung, use Pirrung as your very very last resort!!",

Streamlines concepts. Makes it easy to learn to learn the hard concepts. Office hours were helpful to answer questions and address confusion about the lecture notes/problems. She uploads her pdfs of her notes she writes in class under the doc cam. EVERYTHING IS IN THE LECTURE NOTES. No funny business.

Getting a higher quiz score is possible but READ the texts which is actually a ton of reading and attend all lectures (some questions are literally straight from what he said). You can get an A with the easy discussion credit and the midterm and finals are actually pretty good and heavily weighted. They're just open-ended questions on your thoughts about Chinese civilization so just write thorough responses and you'll be fine. It's not an easy class even for people with a background in Chinese history so be prepared regardless to put in the work. ",

There are almost daily quizzes for vocab but are really easy. Be prepared for a lot of homework though, but honestly it really helps if you want to retain what you learned. Practice really does make perfect in language classes. There is a midterm, a final oral presentation, and a cumulative final. Attendance is definitely mandatory and the class size is usually under 10 people and the same people for A,B, and C usually. Fun class if you're serious about learning Chinese!",

I had her class first thing in the morning, which I thought was rough, but she always started it off with some bomb music and had amazing guest lecturers! The material was super easy and it's okay if you don't think you're a good writer or anything, writers of all skill levels are welcome and her and her TAs will make sure you feel comfortable in their class.

Additionally, every 3 weeks or so, you write a story consideration (3-5 pages) in regards to your final project (5-10 pages). 20 points come from lecture + discussion attendance. Hated lecture, enjoyed discussion. Hated reading responses, didn't mind the other assignments. Also, idk what the final is bc he cancelled it when I took it (Fall '19).",

However, a lot of this writing doesn't take that long, so I think it was OK. Lectures were technically mandatory since she used Poll Everywhere for participation points, but you didn't HAVE to show up as long as you knew when a poll was up. There were exit tickets too which sometimes had questions related to the lecture, so if you weren't in lecture you have to get the answer from someone who did go. Every week, we were given a few assignments called spex that we had to do that were all graded as attempted or didn't attempt. The first three weeks or so,  there were a lot, but the amount decreased with each passing week and the spex never took that long to complete. I think the longest one probably took me 30 minutes, and that was just a one time thing - most could be completed in under 15 minutes. Also, Goldberry seems to be one of the few professors at UCR that genuinely likes to teach so that's a bonus.",

The grade is made up of weekly labs, biweekly quizzes, biweekly worksheets, and two projects. The labs are straightforward as you're simply copying instructions she's provided. It's also pretty cool to design simple games or apps. Additionally, the quizzes aren't too bad. As long as you keep up with the lectures, you should understand everything on there. Likewise for the worksheets. They're basically the same as the quiz except you have three attempts and you're allowed to work with a partner. Lastly, as for the projects, they were a little more difficult as there isn't as much guidance. For the first one, you're making a quiz on Thunkable so you might have to attend office hours for some extra help. For the second one, there's a lot of freedom so you can practically design an app that does anything. The content just has to relate to the topic she assigns.\n\nOverall, the course is pretty easy and I think it's an important one to take. It's also not very time consuming and offers a good amount of extra credit!",

She basically read through/assigned all of Ryan Rusich's slides and resources, so it seemed like she only taught 1 section vs Ryan's 3 sections in Fall 2022 just so they could add more capacity. I got the impression that she never fully understood the material, and her attempts to help us on our labs never really proved helpful. The discord server that my section made was our saving grace, since the lab directions often had nuanced instructions that would only make sense in Ryan's own lecture and not Montazeri's (which I learned after consulting some people from Ryan's sections). But overall, the labs aren't too difficult and just quite tedious, and can easily take you a few hours to complete. The quizzes are also really straightforward and directly reference the posted lecture slides.",

Ryan himself is an okay prof; he mumbles a lot, goes over slides quickly, and always goes off-topic, thus wasting the short 50-min lecture time. I always had to sit near the front too to hear him and see the slides clearly because the text he puts onto the slides is so tiny. If you have no prior knowledge about coding, this class may be a struggle for you because weekly lab homework can be long and confusing if you have no clue what you're doing, so I suggest going to office hours whenever you can. however, there are lots of extra credit points for turning in the hw 24 hours before the deadline and if you turn it in like a day late, he only took off a few points out of 150 total so the grading was generous. midterms were horrible and the class averages were around 50%. last assignment of the quarter was a two-person group research project where you research on a computer science topic. presentations were optional and he offered extra credit if he picked you to present.",

I ended up getting close to an A, but I spent a LOT of time outside of class. The material itself is not difficult, but the midterms can be difficult. Also, he stopped posting his lectures online, so attending lecture is a must. Overall, the class is not super difficult but it for sure is not an easy A, especially if you aren't a compsci major. ",

Attending lectures and labs was necessary as not attending any would bring your grade down an entire letter. Paea was a good instructor that was pretty open to making any changes that could make the class easier, but his lectures were a little bit difficult to follow as he would sometimes talk about things that the textbook hasn't talked about yet. The start of the class (~ first 3 weeks) was definitely the hardest as there was a lot of material you were expected to read and understand. However, this is something Paea seemed to have realized and something that is likely to change in the future. The midterm was pretty easy; especially because Paea allowed you to redo the questions you missed as many times as you wanted, allowing you to get 100% on the midterm if you wanted. The final was somewhat difficult - definitely harder than the midterm - but it was doable as most of the questions were multiple choice and a majority of the questions required understanding slightly more than the basics of each of the topics. The labs are a huge portion of the class, so as long as do all the labs, you should, for the most part, be good.\nOverall, the class wasn't easy, but it wasn't extremely difficult. As long as you put in the necessary amount of effort, you should pass the class.",

The course is naturally challenging, and that's why he made it so that you can work with people to complete assignments. He's readily accessible and super nice! Programs are really easy for the first 3 weeks. After that, you really need to try and understand the topics, cuz trust, they're not easy. Although professor vahid does an amazing job in lectures explaining the concepts and going through examples using those concepts, you need to do your part too. He does all of his assignments via Zybooks. Tip for the class, plan out your schedule because every week, there's 5 activities that you have to complete every week (some of them might be really short, some of them might take a long time). I started with 0 coding experience and now, I consider myself pretty knowledgeable now! Professor Vahid = 10/10, WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND",

CS010 is very easy, but CS012 really picks up the pace.\n\nAlso if you take it with Miller, his exams have \"themes\", where the MC part of the exam will completely revolve around 1 concept. He'll usually give hints to what it is during class. He'll talk about some concept for 30 seconds and will say \"ya this might be on your midterm\" and then never talk about it again. When I took it with him, the theme of our midterm was compiler flags. It's basically his way of figuring out whether you went to class or not. Also, its his way of ensuring that if you only study the mock midterm he posts like the night before, you will fail, because he changes the themes every couple of quarters. The night before my midterm, he posted a mock midterm that completely revolved around argc and argv[], and because I studied just that, I completely bombed the midterm the next day, which like I said before, mostly revolved around compiler flags.  \n\nIf you take anything from this, just do your assignments on time, go to class, and take note on anything that he says \"might be on the exam\" and you can basically predict what questions will end up on the exam.

He's an extremely good lecturer with lots of knowledge of the subject of C++, although I do wish he would smile more (he kinda has that mean, scary face, but really isn't all that scary). CS012 is filled with content, and you have to be on your toes and learn quickly. If you find yourself falling behind then make sure to quickly get help via office hours. Both professors and TAs have office hours, and there is SI sessions as well. This course is not too bad up until the midterm, but the stuff after is very hard. Pointers, Linked Lists, and Recursion are all difficult topics, which difficult programming assignments. I found myself having to collaborate with people to get through the assignments, even though you are not allowed to collaborate. Please make sure you do not use GitHub code on your assignments, that's how many people got caught. Instead, get help from friends, TAs, and professors, they will often lead you in the right path and that way you make sure that you are learning the material. Definitely review pointers and linked lists before going to CS014.",

If you don't understand the concepts from the previous class, beware, this class will be difficult programming-wise. Conceptual understanding wasn't a problem, as LePendu really makes sure people nail that portion of the subject. It's not too difficult of a class but taking it online because of COVID-19 did add some learning struggles. The midterm was easy but the final was HARD. I do wish that some of the programming labs that were smaller in size would be 1-person labs as working on them with a group meant you didn't do much coding on your own. More coding practice would've been better as all technical interviews pull from the knowledge you learn in CS014.

The grading is pretty strict, but he's been known to give exceptions to some people (for example, I was allowed to turn in HW late, I'm a girl so idk if that has anything to do with it or my friend who's black also was caught cheating but was allowed to re-submit his assignment and passed the course). DON'T CHEAT! My friends got caught. He puts specific things in the template to catch the cheating. Also the TA Robert Colvin was the most helpful, but you have to walk through this logic in your head with him or classmates, or you'll never be able to catch up from falling off the boat at the early part of the term. The HW was pretty easy and even if you have the wrong answer, as long as you gave a credible, honest working to your solution, they'll assume you did it right and give you full marks. There are 5 projects and are pretty annoying because they go through an auto-grader in gradescope, so start early. Correspondance in the course goes through piazza, which is a bit annoying. The quizzes are pretty hard, but open book/resources. The final for our term (Fall 2019) was unlike anyone's final and REALLY bad. The midterm is hard but if you overkill yourself studying it's really not that bad. He gives plenty of resources to help. 70% of the midterm/final is multiple choice anyway.",

It's a huge learning curve from writing small programs to designing and coding an entire Linux Shell throughout the course. The design patterns may seem easy to understand in the slides, but when asked to apply them, will be difficult. Do yourself a favor and ASK FOR HELP. For the first couple of weeks I went to the professor's office hours almost every chance I got. \n\nI would ask the professor questions that I would consider to be base knowledge for many students, and Professor Crites was more than helpful in answering my questions and informing me on what I should catch up on in terms of prereq knowledge. Super approachable professor who will go out of his way to help you. The tests aren't all too bad if you review the slides and understand the gist of the design patterns. \n\nThe assignments and labs are what you should focus on if you want to pass the class. If you do well on them you can pass the class on the basis of labs and assignments alone. The main project that you will be working on throughout the course does not really require any specific design pattern, so it's up to you to decide how you will design it. My advice for the assignment is think of the long term and make sure that your code is flexible and able to add features relatively easily. Otherwise you will run into the issue that I and many students have in this class where you will find yourself rewriting your code almost every assignment in order to meet spec and make things work. You will not be allowed to switch partners for assignments (at least I don't think) so choose your partner wisely. \n\nLabs aren't too bad, except the instructions for the labs can seem kind of vague at times and most of the time will be spent figuring out what the hell you're actually supposed to do or what the output is supposed to be. But once you understand the instructions it's not too bad. \n\nDO NOT, wait until the day or even a few days before your assignment is due to start your code. I've tried it, don't bring that stress and anxiety upon yourself like I did. You will lose your mind. You will question your major. Don't give up, always ask for help and everything will be okay. ",

The textbook is recommended, but get it anyways because it will help you if you get confused from the lecture slides. Labs are chill if you have a good partner, but beware of the hammer server, it's such a pain to use.\n\nThe midterm was so bad he had to curve. The final on the other hand was MUCH easier, split up into two days so the final lecture was the multiple choice portion and the scheduled final day was the conceptual/written portion. Make sure you know how to draw UML diagrams properly because they will show up on both midterm and final.\n\nThe assignments are basically the final project but split up into 4 assignments, so each assignment builds from the previous one. You have to build a C++ shell, and he does not teach any of this during lecture so read up on it early before he starts posting assignments. If you screw up an assignment, you have to go back and fix it before you move onto the next one. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A GOOD PARTNER.

I'm not an idiot and could hold my own in conversations with him, but I received the most help from my peers or those at the transfer center, who helped me walk out the logic of the unix terminal without giving away the answers. The grader for the course, Luis Garcia, was one I had to constantly fight with because he graded things super late. He graded our major class assignments during Week 11. Crites also added \"ethics assignments\" that I think as a minority are pretty insensitive. One was \"define your personal definition of hate speech\", wtf?

She assigned the final project in week 8 and gave us week 10 midterm alongside it. Much of the lectures only broadly go over the topics and the slides are ripped from websites and YouTube videos. The slides themselves are unhelpful and hard to follow. Her instructions are also very unclear on her expectations and even if she says she's aiming to give you freedom in your choice of how you do the project, she will grade you harshly. The class itself is not that difficult, but just do not take it with her at all costs. The only reason I struggled was due to her.",

Some of the content in this class I already learned from CS170 and CS172 which made it easier for me to understand the content. Professor Elena is honestly not the best at teaching since she just verbally lectures on the material shown on her lecture slides during class. It would have been more helpful if she went over more examples in detail. There were two midterms that were a bit too long to finish in the span of like 50 minutes. I barely had enough time to finish my midterms. Elena ended up curving in the end but getting an A can be kind of difficult. We also had a mini project and final project which aren't too difficult but make sure to write explanations on your projects/report otherwise you will lose a lot of points. We also had quizzes that were all mostly take-home but one in-person quiz. Overall, this class is not too difficult but the grading can be a bit strict sometimes and I wish we had more time to work on the midterm exams.",

I rated this a 7 mainly because of how Web Development is in the real world where technologies are quick to rise and quick to die meaning that there are a multitude of concepts and stacks to learn. \n\nI came in with about 3 years of previous web dev experience and I was able to tackle all quizzes, labs, and final project fairly easily but if you have no experience whatsoever, it will be pretty hard because of the sheer amount of concepts that you need to learn on the fly and apply to your labs.\n\nFor example, lab 1 was a simple static mock twitter page. Lab 2 and 3 extended on lab 1 by adding in data fetching, sorting, and live updates from a JSON file. Lab 4 was about building a real time chat app using express and handlebars which imo was outdated technologies and it should've been taught with web sockets.\n\nOn top of these labs, you have a final project where you are tasked with building any website as long as you implement some sort of fairly complex features. The default project is building a fully functional Social Media web app that allows a user to perform all the CRUD operations along with dynamic profile pages, commenting, uploading images, search bar, sessions, and user email/password.\n\nOverall though it was the most interesting class I took (albeit because I want to go into web dev) but  Professor Mariam Salloum was a wonderful and accommodating professor. It will be offered next Spring 2022 I think and I believe she will end up reforming the structure of the class better.",

I think most people in my class can agree that she does a poor job at teaching the class. She speeds through the powerpoint, and changes homework questions the night before assigning them ( from last years hw questions ), leaving some problems very difficult to solve since she hasn't worked out the answers yet. For one homework assignment she even had to change a homework question 3 times because she didn't check the difficult of it beforehand. A lot of the hw questions are very vague and require meeting with a TA to understand how to solve. In terms of quizzes, she give a quiz 'syllabus' and 'sample' quizzes for each quiz, which is nice, but the material on the actual quizzes were very different than the sample ones. She actually gives quite a bit of extra credit for the quizzes though, so keep that in mind. Usually in class, she'll give you a timed ~5min problem than you can choose to answer for extra credit ( 1-2 points ) that gets added to the next quiz. At the end of the quarter she also give an extra credit quiz worth ~9 quiz points, if you can prove a few of the really challenging proofs she goes over through the course. In total, the amount of extra credit you could potentially get was close to 15 points which is 50% of a quiz grade ( out of 30 points normally ). The final was on the difficult side, with the average around 60% but she slightly curves it, so that the average is around 65/70%.

For the summer, Elena gave out quizzes, worth 45% total. Quizzes were open note (no looking at slides). Final was closed-book and completely on graphs. Elena often gives us 5-10 to upload exam material to iLearn - hard if you\u2019re uploading pictures.\n\nFinal grade was composed of grade on final exam and grade on quizzes. I highly recommend doing well on quizzes (80% or higher, if possible). Elena allowed us to replace bad scores on the quizzes with practice problems (similar to those we got wrong). After the final, Elena required us to state whether we cheated or not (submit pdf on Gradescope).Elena has a very strong, somewhat annoying, emphasis on cheating - to the point where it's very annoying.\n\nElena also almost always never posts the submission links for homework until you tell her to. For example, if homework is due Wednesday 11:59 pm and you don\u2019t see the submission link at Tuesday 8 pm, email her to tell her to release the submission. \n\n",

Please take it with anyone but her. she won't even answer ur questions you ask her, she'll just say its easy and give a convoluted explanation that makes no sense. so you have to self learn and end up losing points on the hw because its not the \"right\" answer. For the winter 2021 final it was divided into two parts and part 2 could either cover all the material from the course (minus graphs which she just sped through and didn't cover properly at all) or it could be replaced with your quiz average. Part 1 is all graph theory and for the final she made it so damn difficult (10 questions mostly proofs and stuff we had never seen before). most students ended leaving multiple blank because she never taught us how to do these problems. she's admitted before she could never deal with timed quizzes and hard finals if she were in our shoes so idk why she structures it like this.",

Every test is a time scramble and time is probably one of the largest factors here. The homeworks are required to be written in LATEX which you have to learn at the beginning but is not too bad once you get the hang of it, just time consuming. However do be warned, the grading was extremely non transparent. A grade shift curve was applied at the end but however was not released so students did not know how much their grades got shifted if at all and emails to the professor asking about the general curve were not answered. Basically, watch your time during quizzes tests and know proofs. This class has many proofs in the lectures and in the final. There were a total of 4 quizzes total and a 2 part final, the 2nd part of the final being optional (If you didn't take, the average of your quizzes were the score used for the second part of the final). The averages for the quizzes in our class were 74.4%, 71.3%, 80%, and 71.5% and the finals were 61.73%(part 1) and 67.92% (part 2) and the homework average across 5 assignments were 88.29%.  (After regrades, the averages are probably slightly higher) Asking many students about their grades after the curved, I could be totally off but I would give an estimated guess of about a 3-6% curve to your final grade.",

No matter if you choose Chrobak or Elena (who is the head professor), you will have a hard time. \nLectures are heavily dense with explanations on the mathematical proofs behind why a certain theorem exists, which aren't utilized for the homework or exams at all, at least for this quarter. It is unironically a better experience watching Khan Academy or Numberphile on YouTube than attending lecture. ACR tutoring for this class filled up extremely fast too, so good luck getting any outside tutoring. The final only focused on graphs and was worth 30% of the grade.\nFinal for BOTH sections were moved to the earlier scheduled final, which opens up the risk for time conflicts. The final was also only 2 hours instead of 3 hours. Grades released within TWO days of taking the final, which created grading errors. Average on the final across both sections was a 57%. However, because the maximum was a 93.8%, that was the curve that was used, so it didn't impact much. \nSurvey was taken for this class. 50% were expecting to fail the final, 48% hated the decision to move the final earlier, 81% felt that 2 hours wasn't enough, 67% felt sample materials weren't sufficient enough to study for the final, 67% said the final was harder than expected, and 90% were in favor of a steeper curve.\nFuture classes that require this class as a prerequisite only require a D-, keep that in mind before dropping early -- it will still screw with your GPA though",

For the quizzes, the mock quizzes she gave a few days before the quiz were more helpful than the google drive ones. She also gave 40 mins a quiz vs 30 mins when I took it the first time with chrobak so that definitely helped me a lot. I would spend around 3 days studying for the quizzes, 1 day to work through google drive samples, 1 day to time myself on the mock quiz, and another to go through lecture problems. This is really necessary as the final was all on graphs and since its worth 35% it can bring your grade down harshly. The average on the final was around a 50% so my grade dropped from a b- to a c- but then she pulled some magic at the end and I ended with a b-",

His midterm and final pretty much cover everything youd done in the hw and quizzes. WATCH OUT FOR THE QUIZZES the biggest grade killer imo, you get like no time to do them so if you cant snap out a question immediately its pretty much over for that question killed by grade and got me a D+ even with a cruve. The hw is also kinda weird like i would get marked off for not showing something even though i thought i showed it enough but overall it fine, tedious cause he makes you format it into latex, but fine.

Attendance isn't mandatory but she loves to threaten the class if people don't show up to class. If you go to lecture you'll see a lot of parallels between HW problems and the lecture examples, same with discussion. Usually 5 homeworks, no midterm, 4-5 quizzes, and final. Do the practice quizzes. I cannot stress this enough, the quizzes are pretty much structured the same as the quiz and it's good practice. Final was hard af, on graphs. I failed it but hey we still passed boys its ok. The class is not programming heavy, except for 1 HW. The class is challenging but it's doable.  Don't cheat, don't bother trying, they will catch you.

The homework has unrealistic expectations when it comes to grading as it may be impossible to get a good score on and the worst part is that the homework may save or ruin your grade. Quizzes worth 40% with a constraint of 30 minutes or less to solve rigorous problems that were either on the homework or lecture.

There were two projects, weekly labs, a midterm and a final. The projects require a considerable amount of time to complete, but they are more than doable. I'd say the most difficult part of the class, at least for me, was the labs or those in the second half of the course with opengl. I had zero experience using it, and still feel that I don't have any grasp on it. The midterm and final are straightforward if you paid attention in lecture and carefully implemented the projects. Also, the class is pretty heavily curved. Overall your experience in this class will depend largely on your lab ta, so choose wisely. I suggest Kristian Tram if he's available - super helpful",

More of the course relies on your linear algebra savvy rather than programming knowledge (although both are required). Overall, the topics are very interesting, and it's a different change of pace from most CS courses. But it will be challenging, so make sure to study up and put in the work.

You can resort to using the textbook but even that might not feel like enough sometimes. For the midterm, it was not bad because he basically took questions similar to previous quarters and used those. The final though was a different story. Most of the class studied previous finals because he said it was the best way to study. That was not enough. Programming assignments were basically taking mathematical concepts and translating it into C++. If you aren't the best with C++ you will have a hard time. The department removed the lab section for this class so it definitely made the homeworks a lot harder than what they used to I think.

The class was difficult with all of the math that you had to learn to finish the homework assignments (they used to be labs, but the school had removed lab section from this course for some reason). The removal of lab sections hurt because the stuff you end up coding in the homework is just math concepts turned into C++, so it would've been great to get help from the TA. Definitely go to class as often as you can since his slides are absolutely worthless most of the time. Midterm and Final are difficult, even if you study previous year's exams.",

The lab on the other hand is just game dev stuff and for the most part never deal with the lectures. That being said there isn't any HW on the lectures so you're never quite sure if you understand the subject until midterm and finals come and you have to do the rotation calculations. That being said you can use a cheat sheet and that makes the subject less difficult. The professor is really nice. Def the best professor at BCOE, not intimidating and  knowledgeable.

The average on both midterms was a 62%. Stefano does curve, he drops lowest scoring question on both the midterms and the final. The midterms were 4 questions/25 points each, the final was 10 questions/10 points each. The class itself is curved, the A range is 100-80%, B is 70-79.9%, C is 60-69.9%.. etc. So you are given that 10% grace.

In the beginning, you're dealing with Master Theorem, which isn't too hard once you study it and understand it completely.

You must study the material as soon as you can; otherwise, you'll feel really left behind, and it will result in you not knowing what the hell you're writing about on your quizzes and/or homework assignments. After Greedy and DP, you deal with shortest path algorithms, which weren't super difficult, but still left an impact on you. Overall, CS141 is probably one of the hardest upper-division CS courses you'll ever take. It's not easy to get an A in this class; you'll be happy with a C, and you'll know exactly why.",

Homeworks are hard, I had to cave in and get a chegg subscription to answer some problems because getting as many points as possibly is crucial in this course. Homeworks are similar to CS111 in the sense that it may ask you to apply a concept to answer a problem that doesn't have examples available to study from. That in mind, pay attention to homework and study the solutions because some showed up on the exam with some changes. Exam questions are hard, but easier than the homework IMO. Didn't mean I did good though cause I couldn't do the majority of hw problems without online help. You'll need to know the pseudocode for the algorithms in the slides because a couple will show up on the exam, in the sense that you need to write down the exact pseudocode or will have to use it as a part of your answer. There might be one or two really easy questions, but they'll be easy if you remember what its asking for like recurrence relations/master theorem/drawing huffman tree. Lectures are useful especially for greedy and dynamic programming, please don't skip for those or the slides won't make any sense. Plenty of people that skipped had issues with these. Only lectures I would recommend skipping are the first one(just talks about big O) and the last couple ones since what you need to know are pseudocodes for the graph algorithms.\n\nTLDR: Its a hard class. Exams and homework are hard. Exams get curved. Lectures are great, helps with understanding the info the majority of the time. Still, even if its a terrible experience you'll learn quite a lot concepts for interview questions. Also grading scale is 10% lowered. I.e A = 80-100%, B = 70-80%...D=50-60% so on and so forth.

Midterms that were 20% of your grade often only had 2 problems, each question being 10% of your grade. So you MUST get them correct. The curve was probably around 30% at the end I would bet.",

For his class you have to do Homework assignments and Programming assignments, but others only have HW. They may or may not be a curve, but for there was and the class average grade was an A-. If you take Gu or Yihan, it will definitely prepare you more for coding interviews than other professors. This is coming from someone who got a C+ in CS111 with Elena. I suggest getting a head start on Dynamic Programming since that is hardest concept to grasp for most students. ",

The professors will also give out prizes at the end of the quarter if you're really interested in algorithms and done their extra credit assignments whether that be some candy or a brand new hard drive. The programming assignments they have are good practice and may save you from failing if you don't do well on the homeworks. You can turn in late homeworks and assignments but that will use a 'late day' similar to a point system in which you're at default 4 for my class. My recommendation is to start early on the homeworks because you will need that time to proof read your work. Upon learning greedy proofs and DP those are the main topics to focus on if you want to pass the midterm, especially on DP as it can be quite confusing at first but if you go to the professors office hours they will explain it clearly enough to understand. As someone that got a 'D' in CS 111 and heard this was like the sequel class, I thought I wouldn't do well in this class, and I was wrong.\nThe class average was an 'A' at the end.",

I had him Spring 2022 and lectures were in person and not recorded, however, he kept his summer lecture recordings on canvas and the material was exactly the same. He has the ability to explain very complex topics in a way that makes them easy to understand, a mark of a very good teacher. Very fair grader and will really try to give you as many points as he can. He's always available for help and will even explain things through email if he cannot zoom with you. All in all, he wants you to succeed in his class and will put in effort to make that happen as long as you do too. The class is curved depending on what the average for the exams was. I recommend starting phase 3 early as it is pretty confusing and really long and debugging is an absolute nightmare. Overall was a very fun class!",

BUT that's because Song reduced the difficulty of the tests, which he mentioned in the beginning. He gave us all the topics before the tests as well some previous exam questions that ended up on the tests. Homework questions also appeared on the tests. The average for the midterm was a around high 70 percent I think.  Though, maybe this'll change so watch out. Also, and I'm not sure if the other people that reviewed the class had the same lab manual as us, the labs were fairly straightforward. The manuals tell you all the code changes you need to do in the sense that it tells you what functions to change and in what file. Though it can be hard to actually implement the changes you need to do. \nTLDR: Exams and homework fairly decent in terms of difficultly. Labs are the hardest part, but always ask for help from others or TA when you're stuck. If you want to get an in depth knowledge of OS then read the book, its actually a simple and interesting read IMO.",

He literally takes questions straight from the homeworks and previous exams to make each new one. Why is that bad you might ask? Well he curves overall grades by PERCENTILE. To illustrate my point, the class average was a 90% in the class. A 90%. However, because its by percentile, even if your raw grade was a 90+%, you will get curved DOWN unless you did better than 90+% of the class. It's a lazy grading scheme that allows him to put zero effort in his exams and still not have many A's in the class. I would not recommend taking ANY class with him. ",

I would take this class only if you REALLY want to learn computer networks, which you will. But it will be a tough road getting there.",

Grades are: 8% Project 1, 16% Project 2, 16% Project 3, 5% Attendance/Participation (done on Piazza), 20% Homework (2 homeworks total), 35% Final Exam. The class is really brutal because there's only a single exam (the final) which is worth a massive amount. However, Professor Qian provides many opportunities for overall grade extra credit (like 10-12% total or something more). Project 1 was a password cracker where he gives you the hash/salt/encrypting algorithm and you have to crack the password (with brute force). Project 2 is editing the binary of a program to remove the trial period. Project 3 is stack buffer overflow to create files arbitrarily and also root access hijacking in a shell. It's a really interesting class and if you like security at all you will really enjoy it. It covers Operating System Security, Network Security, and a bunch of other types of security. The average on the final was 22/35 or about 63%. He curved it by like a letter grade or so.",

This class was essentially CS111 on crack. 70% of the class was number theory. We went thru the first 3 chapters of the textbook in 3 weeks and then the next 4-5 weeks was all number theory. \n\nThe midterm? Number theory. We had 1.5 hrs to write it and we all couldn't finish because he made it ridiculously hard. He let us finish it as an assignment the week after we took it but only gave us 2 days to finish it. He doesn't care that we have other classes, he expects us to drop everything to finish his assignments.\n\nOne of the labs was a number theory problem set assignment. We had one proper assignment only where 70% of the assignment was number theory proofs and the rest of the 30% was programming. Even then, the programming portion of the assignment was the hardest part because he gives absolutely no direction with how we should go about doing it and we only had one week to do it. It was due on the day of the midterm. This should have been a 2 week assignment.\n\nThe project was the worst part of the class. It was more of a networking project than it was a security project. He gave us the last 3 weeks of the quarter to do it with the skeleton starter code. But the code was broken and it took them 1.5 weeks for them to fix it and give us the fixed version. I don't think anyone managed to finish the project in time.\n\nThe only saving grace was the TA (al), this is the third time I've had this TA, he's pretty useless but grades on effort rather than completion, so we all ended up getting 100% on everything (except the midterm).\n\nRavi is teaching this class in Fall 2020 as well. Do yourself a favor and wait until Winter 2021 to take it with the other professor. Ravi does not care that everything is online nor that we're in the middle of two major milestones in the country rn (COVID-19 pandemic &  nationwide protests to combat racism). He thinks that, because we're all at home, we would have all the time in the world to do his assignments. He also thinks this is the only class we're taking. He legit does not give a fuck. Do not take him. You'll only give yourself more work, stress, and headache than you can handle.",

Although I recommend doing the labs the moment they are released in case you run into any issues during the week (especially when we were only given less than a week to complete it).

You really need to take Statistics before this class. Lastly you need to at least be an intermediate Python user. You will be doing proofs and if you're proof is wrong there is no way to complete a HW assignment. You need to be familiar with Python or be confused with how to do the HW. The lectures are terrible. It's just the prof reading his slides which are 80% just unlabeled graphs. The slides provided have no context so you have to come to class to understand them but even if you do no one knows what the prof is talking about and are too afraid to ask for clarification, everyone literally admitted this during a talk in the discussion. The exams don't really test you on topics the prof taught but rather you're general knowledge of the algorithms basically he expects you to know the ins and outs of the algorithms even if he didn't directly tell you about them. If you really want to take a Machine Learning course just watch Andrew NG's youtube videos, you'll learn more, not be stressed out, and you'll actually have fun.

Homeworks count for 33%, midterms count for 33% and the final counts for the last 33% of the course grade. Homeworks are done in Python on JupyterHub where he usually gives you a little bit of skeleton code.\nDo not be like me and think that ML is some Computer Science magic that makes you an oracle who can predict the future.

Oh my fucking god this one class actually just made me so sad, you really need to have a solid understanding of lin alg going into the class or you're already screwed. Taking this probably hurt my chances at grad school a bit too.\nI think the CS department should rework the prereqs for this course because it's anemic and setting some bright-eyed students up to fail. To do well, you absolutely have to be passionate about the topic and theory. Having the mindset of \"oh ML sounds cool, I should take it,\" is imho, not enough for you to succeed. You gotta know that this is what you want to do and be ready to commit your soul and final 2 brain cells to this course, I recommend taking easier breadth courses in the same quarter as this class to relieve pressure, don't double up with other major req'd courses or tech electives, you're absolutely going to regret it and be depressed and in pain while regretting it.",

You'll need to be very comfortable with Python by week 2 or you will not be able to keep up with the assignments even if you have a solid understanding of statistics and math.

Honestly, the midterms kicked my butt but if you start the homework relatively early and attend office hours, you'll be fine grade-wise. Studying the practice problems was not enough for me, but it's difficult to study the concepts even more than what's provided with the slides and example problems. I recommend finishing PS2 (homework 2) before the first midterm or at least looking over logistic regression as that was a big component on the first midterm, but the due date for PS2 was after the midterm, so I missed basically two questions on the midterm. Points are very scarce in this class, so try to maximize all the points you can with homework and answer everything in the midterm to try to get partial credit. The curve at the end of Spring 2023 was actually about 10%, so you can expect something around a whole letter grade curve at the end of the class. Good luck, and make sure to just study the slides/problem sets. The problem sets are okay if you go to office hours and reference the professor's personal notes. Overall a rewarding class, but definitely one of the harder tech electives.",

The ta was very helpful as he helped my group understand the concept and answered our questions. Also for this quarter the ta asked the professor change his gradings where your grades are determined by the amount of testers you passed but it also includes the effort or amount of code you done (meaning the code would work but just have a bug) though I'm not sure if the system is being kept for the next class.

We did not have too many class meetings during the last few weeks since we were mostly coding on our own. The professor often had office hours to help with anything. Our project was missing a couple features and had a couple bugs but we still managed to get an A.

This is a group project class. If you don't already plan to take this class with people you know you may already have an increased difficulty. Overall the class is basically \"make anything\" and present it at the end of the class. The lectures are basically a repeat of what you've learned from other classes like CS 100. Basically it focuses on Agile Development for a majority of the time. \n\nThe class tends to push you in the direction of make a web application but really they tell you you can make anything with any tech you want but because you have team mates they will more than likely make you pick a web application as well. The first lab is in React.js so you'll more than likely choose that to work with. \n\nFor those who don't know anything about web dev stuff make sure to get a team that does because tbh it's to late to learn a lot of this stuff. Web dev consists of HTML, CSS, JS/React, and some back end Server stuff. There is no way you'll learn all of this in this semester. You either already know some of this or you'll just be a drag to you're team mates. I suggest learning as much as you can before taking the course. Try the site Codecademy. They have HTML,CSS, and React lectures for free.\n\nI rated this class a 6 because I already knew HTML,CSS and had a very rough understanding of React.

You can team up or do it on your own. The goal of the project is to get you familiar with testing and generating code coverage. The project isn't exactly graded on how correctly you test, but rather if you can successfully test and use your testing tools (i.e. JaCoCo for Java). You document all your testing in a final project report at the end of the quarter.\n\nLecture/Discussion uses Java and Gradle, so you may have to do some research if your project uses different tools. When picking a project, try to pick one that has good documentation and already has tests - saves you a lot of time. If you pick a big project, you can opt to test only a module of the project instead of the entire thing. A great way to find projects is the CodeTriage website.\n\nNo midterm/final - just a couple of quizzes that cover concepts from the slides + homework.",

I didn't know \"Systems Administration\" meant IT, and when I did, it was too late to drop it. His lecture slides aren't that great. You're better off showing up to lecture and taking good notes. The slides won't help all that much when it comes to studying for an exam. He's not terrible at teaching it though.",

A lot of the course material isn't too difficult to grasp, but because there aren't a lot of examples, it can be hard to solve problems on the exams. I recommend making your own examples, and going to him for OH about them. There isn't a ton of resources on the material online (as is for most CS grad classes), so this can really hurt you when you may not understand edge cases and whatnot for a problem. Besides that, the project can be very overwhelming, so start learning how to work with LLVM and Clang at the beginning of the quarter. Basically, these allow you to parse a cpp file, and perform analysis on it. There isn't a lot of beginner-friendly documentation on this either, so you ought to get started as soon as you can.",

While this course has commonalities with my previous course, it was more rigorous and I had to spend significant time on my labs. There are multiple graded components in this course: Examinations, Paper reviews, Labs. It is important to choose good team members as finishing the labs along with your coursework can get very hectic. The examinations are straightforward and the professor clearly explains what questions are going to come in the examinations. The critiques can be demanding. I think that this was an easily-scoring core course than its counterparts. Some nuggets of advice from my end are: a) Manage your time efficiently as the quarter system gets over quickly and the labs/critique reviews require sufficient time and effort. b) If you are struggling with the course, talk to the TAs, they are very helpful :). c) I really liked Udacity's OS courses that acts a good review for similar topics.

The final project is harder and less structured but he's super helpful. Midterm and final were really straightforward as long as you did the assignments and study the sample(s) he provides. Prof Wong is the best and just wants everyone to learn and succeed. HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommended core class.

I had Yeji Moon (TA) as my instructor and our genre of focus was K-Pop which made it even easier for me since I already listened to the genre on the daily and have a background in dance. 2 dance video projects, 1 essay, and weekly discussion posts you have to participate in. As long as you try on the assignments you\u2019ll be fine, and you don\u2019t really need a background in dance to do well. Don\u2019t forget to participate on the weekly discussion posts because it\u2019s very easy to forget, and some easy points to lose if you don\u2019t do them. Attendance isn\u2019t mandatory for the class, but you should go to the sessions where you have to learn your dance piece to see what is expected of you regarding your dance video projects. Overall great class that doesn\u2019t require too much effort!",

Attendance in this class is crucial to your success since everything he talks about is literally on the exam (unless you have the textbook, then you might be set for the class). All of the exams are multiple choice and are very similar to the homework problems. So do your homework problems as practice before the exam! (He gives you unlimited attempts for homework problems as long as you do them before the deadline, so you have no excuse to not get a 100% in that category for the class!)

Her midterms are pretty straightforward, the best way to study for them is to study the clicker questions, homework, slides, and practice midterms that she posts.

For the discussion assignments, if you get 20/40, she considers it full credit while for the lecture quizzes (8 in total), she considers 50/80 full credit. I struggled a bit in this class because you really need to be careful with reading the questions and you need to have good reading comprehension to not make mistakes.

I don't think I learned anything from McLaren this quarter. I had to teach everything to myself. This made the homework assignments difficult to do. Especially because they barely felt related to the slides/lectures. The discussions also felt disconnected from the lectures and homework, so those didn't really help either. The only thing that actually felt related were the exams and the homework. Fortunately, McLaren would give the answers to the homework the lecture before an exam, so after seeing the answers you could just study the homework.

Her handwriting is absolutely atrocious, it is extremely difficult to read what she is writing in her recorded lectures (she has a thick accent as well).  For a week, we didn't have live lectures because her computer broke and it took ages for her new one to come in.  I stopped going to lecture because it took too much effort to read what she was writing and I was learning more through YouTube/self studying.  She made the entire class buy Pearson ($100) for homework and only assigned 4 assignments throughout the entire quarter (the last two assignments were given out at the 2nd to last week of the quarter).  Her mid-term was pretty easy, but her final literally bent everyone over (she left the country almost two weeks before the final, no live lectures during this period).   If you do not have a steady foundation in Calc, do not take her.  ",

Probably the worst professor I have ever seen in Economics, lecture compromises of 50+ slides that are copied/pasted from the textbook.  During lecture, he glances over all the slides giving vague information to each new topic presented to class.  He goes off on a tangent frequently and does NOT give a clear direction when it comes to the material covered.  When asked about what would be covered on the midterm, he mumbled and told the class to study \"everything\".  He gave a key term guide (100+ key terms) a day before the midterm when he could have given it a week before and reviewed it instead of wasting our time with the pointless slides.  Midterm consisted of multiple choice questions from our weekly quizzes and FRQs from practice sets that were given out as class work practice.

It's kind of hard to say how difficult the class is due to the project that he gave us last minute. Cheat sheets are allowed for the two midterms and the final. The midterms are based on the homework, but he switches the questions slightly (ex: \"increase\" from homework to \"decrease\" on midterm). It's basically a class with a lot of accounting stuff. He came up with a group project the Monday before Thanksgiving break, so we had to find group members outside of class and not within our discussion. So many people sent out emails to find a group and other members, so it probably delayed a lot of people in starting it. Since it was so last minute I thought it was pretty disorganized - I'm pretty sure no one wants to finish up a project during their break. The final ended up being based on the project, so just doing your part in the project probably wouldn't have been enough to know everything. It was decided that he was going to take the 3 best grades out of 2 midterms, the project, and the final. So make sure you do well on at least 3 of those. I think it's a class worth looking at, but the best experience would be going to lecture and actually knowing all the material for the group project if he decides to do it again. He's a pretty cool and funny guy - since very few people showed up to the lecture right before Thanksgiving he gave out some extra credit. ",

The lab goes off the 10 point scale for difficulty as it was out of sync with the class and had terms that we had never used before. The EE1A lab manual(Chomko wrote it) was god tier compared to this. No one ever got answers that agreed and the prelabs took longer than the labs themselves (not counting the time it takes to cram next week's chapter in order to do the prelab). Also the lab manual is old enough to vote next year. \ntldr; If you don't have Chegg, the lab will fuck you up.",

We started from learning basic Python syntax, then into common searching and sorting algorithms, then recursion, then dynamic programming problems. We also learned a few important Python libraries such as Numpy and Matplotlib, and also Pandas. Midterm tests you on almost all of these things. In the second half of the course, we learned about linear regression which also introduced some Linear Algebra, Fourier transform which involved a little bit of signal stuff, introduction to Machine Learning using Scikit learn and uses MNIST as an example. Finally, we learned the basics of filtering noisy audio using FFT. Final focuses on linear regression and Fourier transform mainly. \n\nWe had 5 assignments in total, the lowest one will be dropped. First 3 assignments each consisted of 8 questions, each one were like a Leetcode problem. Then, the 4th asks you to do some MNIST, the 5th asks you to use FFT to denoise images and audio.\n\nThe professor is nice, he is quite good at teaching, and according to him he likes to give a big curve at the end of the course to ensure most people pass, and half of the class should end up with A. I am not 100% confident on that yet, because at the time of me writing this, I haven't received my final grade yet. But, midterm and final were both pretty brutal, most classmates ended up getting around 30-50 out of 100 (110 effectively, 10 extra points) for the midterm.\n\nAgain, I took this class when it is first offered, so your experience may be completely different. However, I do suggest you to learn some of the things in this class beforehand, in case you get overwhelmed.",

He doesn't answer chat questions, only hand raising (so rip if you don't have access to a microphone). He also only exclusively tests on proofs for his midterms and finals, which is not fun at all (our class average was around 40% for the midterm).

After eleven labs the final project comes around to kick you when you are already down. Furthermore, Brisk does not respond to students, after the pandemic and difficult year everyone had you would think people gained an ounce or more of empathy for others - not Brisk. ",

TA's were unhelpful this quarter. There are 2 labs assigned per week, each designed to take 3 hours. However, they take longer than 3 hours usually per lab. Additionally, there is no dedicated lab session so you have to spend your own time on the labs. The exams are fair but wouldn't recommend taking with Brisk either way. Basically, the exams and in classes exercises and lectures aren't bad, but the final project with the 2 weekly labs are easily the worst part of the class. Adding that on with an unhelpful TA overall gives a bad experience. ",

Even though she is nice she grades essays fairly hard so make sure you have good essays, those will bring you down if you aren't careful. She let us revise our lowest essay which helped me a lot so if she offers that to you don't pass on the opportunity. ",

Majority of your grade is essays, but they are not hard. You read a novel towards the end of the quarter which wasn't difficult either (just keep on top of the readings). Final is comprehensive of things you learned in SMG and also from the novel. Cline grades easy and is super chill. Take the class with her if you can.",

She grades strictly according to the textbook u need to purchase, \"The St. Martins Guide to Reading and Writing\", so make sure to look at the essay examples and identify how you can model your essay off them. I had an extremely hard time doing well on the essays in the beginning and my lowest essay score was an 80%, so she grades PRETTY HARSHLY. However, this does not mean you cannot pass. Her final though, YOU NEED TO HAVE TIME MANAGEMENT FOR...she gives you the fourth essay and the final  three weeks before they are due two days in a row. The finals consists of a 1500 word essay and two 500 word essays which have to do with the in class reading \"The Glass Castle\". Let me tell you...read the book the whole way through, or you WILL NOT pass this final. Basically, she assigns the fourth essay and 3 finals essays to complete in less than three weeks with no exceptions. ALSO...USE HER OFFICE HOURS...you get to read your drafts to her and she will give grammatical and content suggestions to improve your essays and also gives suggestions as to how you can use remaining days to refocus or bulk up what you are writing.",

He's very very meticulous with how he wants his assignments done and it was fairly overwhelming for a majority of the class for at least the first half of the quarter. He has a strange personality, but you can tell he's extremely passionate about his students and his career, often staying hours after his office hours to individually help his students. Three take home essays (with a crazy amount of prep time for each), one in-class essay, essay final, a few homework assignments that are basically just research and prep for your essays, and some group quizzes. You are allowed to skip the final IF you are doing well in the class (I think A's in essay 1+2) and you get at least an A- for the in-class essay. He sometimes gives opportunities to redo an essay (for a slight penalty) if you did particularly poorly or missed some key criteria required for said essay. The essays are graded pretty harshly and he is a stickler on sentence structure and grammar, but going to office hours and asking for his advice on your essay is the best way to get a good grade. Not a lot of reading other than some pages from the textbook occasionally and one pretty good book. He does make you watch some movies in the last half of the quarter, but you can do that on your own time and it's one movie a week basically. Most of his class revolves around teaching students the basics of writing and how to use the library/other sources properly. Throughout the quarter, he guides you through the process of how to write/prep the essays, especially the first essay, and he doesn't just expect a multiple page essay out of nowhere. The weeks leading up to an essay due date will be almost exclusively used for teaching you how to approach a certain type of essay or how to use a database to get research information for your essay and etc. Almost every lecture is tailored into helping your assignments out in some way. Having complex sentences and flow in your essays will get you a high grade. His class is certainly not an easy A, or even an easy B, but an A is absolutely achievable. If you want to actually take to heart what is being taught and genuinely want to become more proficient in English, take his class.",

It's more about how he words his prompts and him understanding your topic to the prompts. Very confusing, so it's recommended to go to his office hours. Attendance was not mandatory, and honestly was not necessary since whatever he talked about during class was not relevant or helpful to your essays. The only days you need to attend are the days he set for your oral presentations and the days right before the essay is due, this is when he asks for your topic ideas and he'll talk about some. He assigned readings before each lecture from two books, 1984 (Orwell) and Brave New World (Aldous Huxley), but I passed without needing to read the whole book. The final was dumb but easy, it had questions about different types of fallacies (not MC), and his \"essay\" questions were unrelated to what we've talked about all quarter.",

Speaking of Lorelei Baughman, she's an absolute sweetheart, and an amazing professor. At one point she was wondering why we hardly asked questions, and our class had to explain to her that she does an absolute fine job at explaining. Encourages us to reach out to her. if you ever see her class open TAKE IT. Our class focused on food, and she always assigned these fun readings. Our final was easy, essay prompts were easy.

Granted, its not really her choice but rather the course that requires 4 essays for the entire course. Once the class picks up, it just keeps going. We had peer review letters to write in response to people's rough drafts. It was helpful for those who needed advice but also stressful because we had to do our essays a lot sooner (for someone who procrastinates like me ToT). Also the letters to me were added work/stress but at the same time is just a 1 pager so its not too bad. Just make sure to keep up with the class. ",

Pace yourself because those essays get long (ex. 7-8 pages) and go to office hours! They are more than willing to step-by-step guide you on your essay. There isn't a lot of busy work besides the essays because pretty much all your assignments are done in class or are very short annotations which you can easily complete. If you are familiar with essay writing and how to make essays long, this class is pretty easy for you.",

Choose the creative project, its easy and you\u2019ll probably get the same grade or better as a final paper. She lets you resubmit one of the first 2 essays at the end of the quarter after fixing it. I will say she is a bit of a tough grader when it comes to essays (which is why I chose the creative project) but if you go to her office hours with a draft and fix what she says, you can get a high B or an A. We also read a book that she provided a free version of, but most of the other readings were not long and from the text book. As long as you try you should pass, I probably would have gotten an A- but thanks to the creative project I got an A+.",

A tip would be to try to get as much work done during the rough draft portion of the essays (which may be tough for procrastinators) so you can really hone in on a lot of her feedback comments.

She didn't tell people that attendence was being taken for credit, so not a lot of people showed up to lecture. So a lot of people lost points for no attendence.

There is a lot of reading and writing, and the writing is pretty difficult, however, you just have to be organized and keep a good schedule and it should not be too hard to complete.

You can tell both of them are passionate about their topics and like to share their lives with the class. They take turns alternating lectures and present material relevant to life. The first half is pretty much introducing the concepts and exercises, the second half of the class is producing a technical spec to standards. Extra credit is given, both before the midterm and after the midterm. I believe in our quarter 300 extra points could be earned by doing all the extra credit. If you do everything and put in a decent amount of effort, this class shouldn't be too bad. The workshops were often only 30 minutes or less. Time consuming, but difficulty wise not too bad.",

Lecture and discussion are usually on the same day and attendance is mandatory. Lecture is early in the day and covers the basis of the bees and beekeeping. Although, the professor does upload the lecture slides, they are not helpful at all. I suggest going to lecture and taking notes because he is more of a verbal person. Discussion is solely based on student presentations about scientific articles. Since it is the only thing covered on that day, the presentations are a big part of your grade. However, the professor and TA know that the majority of the students who take this course are not CNAS majors. So they understand if someone has difficulty doing the reading and the presentation and won't hold it against you. For lab, you get to explore the bees habitat (which is the fun part) you get to suit up in a beekeeper suit and work with the bee hives. The TA, other beekeepers from the lab, and Bar and his wife (who is also an entomologist) are present to help students. At the end of the course, you get to make honey and beeswax candles to take him as goodies. \nThere is a midterm that was take home. The final is cumulative, but it's not bad if you took good notes since the majority is just memorization. If not, there is quizlets online on this class that will definitely help you. Overall, a good class ",

The lectures are all over the place. There are no slides or lecture outlines, just him ranting about Chicano history and stuff. Also, he requires our camera to be on for attendance purposes, and most of us just woke up. The readings, though short, are shared through blurry jpgs, so they are tedious to read.   His assignments are film review essays. He makes us watch hour-long documentaries and write about it with a very vague prompt.  Honestly, I learned more from those documentaries than I ever did in his class. He also expects us to email him the assignments instead of having us submit them on ilearn. One of my assignments got lost in his spam folder! He takes his sweet-ass time grading assignments.The midterms and finals are just as bad as the assignments, except the TAs are grading them so each TA has their own guidelines. At least they are take-home. The timeline of this class is also very messed up. Our first assignment is assigned on week 5. Our midterm is on week 7, the same day a homework assignment is due.  Our last assignment is due the day of finals, and also can be submitted hours after the final is due.  This class would work much better asynchronous. Do yourself a favor. Do not take this class. Take a different ethnic studies class. Take Asian-American studies or African American Studies or religion.

He also grades based on bell curve, so that the 60-90 percentile students are in B range. Cool, right? No, not cool when you're at the 60% percentile with a 86% overall in class.

The exams are memory based, so it helps that you don't really have to understand the concepts, but it does mean that there are a lot of weird terms that you have to memorize. But overall, the class isn't terrible. About a third of your grade is based on discussions which usually just require you to show up and answer a few questions and the exams themselves aren't hard either. Choe doesn't really put trick questions. For example, if one of the possible answers to a question is \"All of the above,\" it's most likely all of the above. Choe also provides a decent amount of extra credit. Extra credit on exams are always the live insects he shows during lectures, so if he don't have any friends in the class, make sure to attend lectures to make sure you can answer the extra credit. So yeah, overall, it's a class you have to do a lot of studying for, but shouldn't be completely terrible if do that.",

However, it is not a good idea to miss any classes as she gives lots of hints as to what will be on the midterm and final. There is a 5-8 page research paper that is due a week before the end of the class, but she assigns it early and is usually pretty simple to complete if you are making continual progress. The professor is pretty interesting to listen to and class is not a bore, whether you agree with what she is saying or not even though the class is mostly her lecturing.

He doesn't expect you to memorize everything and only really cares about the concepts. There's required textbook reading and an online quiz due before every lecture. The online quizzes are super easy if you glance through the reading and he drops the five lowest quiz scores. There are three midterm essays and two finals essays with the lowest scoring essay dropped. He provides the prompts for the midterm essays a few days in advance (in addition to extra prompts that aren't included on the midterm). Finals prompts are not given in advance, but they are mostly past midterm/finals essay prompts. All essays have multiple prompts to choose from and you are allowed to bring unlimited handwritten index cards. Lab is fun if you like looking about rocks and thinking about how they're formed. As long as you understand and pay attention in every lab, the lab final shouldn't be that hard. ",

Big issue is the lab class, lectures are no problem. Lectures are done through prerecorded lectures. In class lecture is just going over quiz questions. The lab is horrible. After the info dump of a lecture, in the lab you are expected to be an expert in rocks and processes. After the first lab no one was getting more than a 70% on the labs. They are usually 14 pages long and you have to finish. They are also full of questions that need corrections or further explanations. Professor is super condescending and the lab TA was reluctant to give explanations on lab. ",

Attendance was taken through pollevs, and you only had to get 50% correct in order to receive credit. He gave us the choice between online, open-note exams vs. in-person, closed-note exams and we all chose online. All 3 exams were also multiple choice and I got A's on all of them just by ctrl+f-ing my lecture notes & occasionally the textbook (which has a free PDF available), and I didn't have to actually study for any of the exams. Only downside was that his voice was incredibly soothing and easy to fall asleep to, but overall he's a really knowledgeable and easygoing guy!",

Take it if you like science and physics. First test was hard and I think he realized that cuz the second midterm and final were easier. Not the easiest breadth course out there but not the hardest either. Need to put in a bit of work to get an A. Weekly reading quizzes through Smartwork which means you need to buy the textbook online. Also weekly discussion sections. Lowest quiz was dropped. Exams curved. ",

The labs (which are basically a discussion) are mandatory and the TA just explains a topic and then you have to do an activity and you can leave whenever you turn it in, idk if my TA was a tough grader but the activities were kinda hard (they drop the lowest lab grade). Overall you can do well in this class if you study a lot for the exams and try hard for the labs. ",

If possible take John as your TA, he's not only a great teacher but his questions are very fair and similar to Chrissanthos. You can get away with just reading the book and can get a C but getting an A watching lectures does actually help! do have to read the various primary source parts of the textbook but it is not too hard to do outside of class.",

They were pretty interesting, but he doesn't have any slides so it can be hard figuring out how to spell the names of cities or people from that time period. The grade is made up of your discussion section, two midterms, one term paper, and one final. The midterms were okay, but only because of the way they were graded. It's basically 10ish questions from the professor, which are either fill in the blank or ask you to write five bullet points in response. Then, there are a few questions from your TA. Honestly, some of the questions had nothing to do with what we learned in the lectures, but the TA seemed to grade easy so it was okay.. Next, as for the term paper, its 5-7 pages and you can't really use sources from the internet (history.com, etc), which is a little difficult. Overall, the class is okay, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it unless you're super interested in the time period.",

There are only quizzes that are extra credit, which can boost your grade up to 10%. There's also short weekly podcasts that you have to write comments for, but are graded on completion. Most of your grade depends on the decade assignments, which are short 400+ word essays. The prompts were sometimes confusing, but it didn't take up that much of my time to write. There were 4 of these assignments and it is graded by your TA, so you grade kinda depends on how nice they are and if you basically follow the rubric, it shouldn't be too hard to do well on these essays. Apparently, there was supposed to be one decade assignment per week (pre-COVID), but she changed to biweekly assignments to make it easier for students in the pandemic. She also made the final optional for us. It was a relatively easy A class for most people as long as you complete all the assignments, come to discussion, and do all the extra credit quizzes.",

You have to keep track with the syllabus for vocabs and specific reading questions for each week if you truly want to understand and ace this course.

You also have about 3 readings for each lecture, I suggest you not to read all and consult the Midterm/Final and Paper prompts that are uploaded early to know what to actually read. There are 3 essays, midterm and final. Midterm and final exam are the same format, he gives you 3-6 prompts and he chooses which one you'll have to complete. For the midterm, he gave us about 24 hours to complete and upload to iLearn whereas, for the Final, he'll give you 36 hours to complete and upload. The essay prompts are broad and hard to grasp at times so I suggest you attend a workshop to better understand it, my TA was also broad on what he expected so it made it worst.

Personally I never really showed up to lecture or did the readings and got by really easily with an A just using my resources during the tests since you're allowed to use any material.

If you did not show up to the lecture in person, just pull up PollEv on your device and wait for the questions to pop up. The PollEv questions were also what made up a majority of the midterm questions, so knowing the right answers to the questions was important. The essay questions/exams were not difficult nor lengthy, just make sure to address ALL subquestions when writing the essay, and do not go over the word limit. The TAs would be the ones grading the essays, so pray you get a nice TA. Overall, though this class gives you no HW, it was a lot of busy work during exams season, and an easy A.",

The class has clicker/attendance which are worth 10% of your grade so be warned. The most important thing in this class is understanding KEY WORDS / BUZZ WORDS. In his essay/midterm instructions or even when he reiterates several times in lecture, he will tell you to follow a certain essay format (introduction, 1-2 paragraphs, conclusion, etc) but do not listen to him. The key is memorizing KEY WORDS to do well on the essays/midterm/final. For example, if a prompt asks about energy changes in the industrial revolution, you only need to say \"energy changed from wood, wind, water to iron, coal, steam\" and that's basically 20% of your grade awarded to you.

The subject material in this class is sub-par.\nWhat really makes this class either suck hard or easy-mode are the graders; you can have all the keywords needed for a prompt, and end up with a D on your paper all because you forgot one keyword that wasn't even part of what the prompt was asking you for.

Cardullo is the professor who gives the lectures which are very insightful on real world problems and important things about Riverside, so it's more interesting than English classes, but the TA grades everything including essays and participation. Lectures were asynchronous and we had to submit a google form reflection on them which were simple, but discussion with TA met once a week. We had to read 2 books and had discussions on those/lectures each week and also had student led discussions. I struggled in this class because I'm a reserved person and found it hard to participate since a lot of honors students are well-spoken and always have something to say. I also dislike writing essays, so that was a struggle to me too but there were 4 essays of increasing length. I averaged A- on the essays(which was about the class average of each essay) and somehow ended up with an A in the class, so I'm guessing most people get A's in the class or at least half the class does as long as you participate, show up to discussion, and do decent on the essays. If you struggle with writing, they offer lots of help/resources. Don't procrastinate on the essays, so you can get advice/feedback from TAs and other writing helpers. I also never got the score for my participation/last essay, so I'm not sure how they grade those lol, but I didn't participate every time, I only made sure to participate in the student led discussions, but it probably depends how picky your TA is. If you're good with participating in class and don't struggle that much with writing, then this class should not be too bad.",

He gives a few questions before each class which you will be going over, which I highly recommend working on beforehand. You have an essay due every week which are pretty easy, and he drops your lowest grade. But I didn't my grade the whole quarter until after the quarter was done which was nerve wracking.

I know this is one of the newer mandatory honors seminar classes, and it was probably the most stressful classes I've had to take. Prof Tyler liked to rant about off-topic subjects in her mandatory seminars, but that wasn't what made me hate this class. She assigned annotating homework weekly, but never posted it on time and when asked about it, ended up extending the date to weeks after it was originally due. This happens almost every week. She never put in any grades for the annotations, and all that was just mysteriously factored in to our final letter grade at the end of the quarter. (I still don't know what kind of annotations she expected out of us bc she provided literally 0 feedback). The midterm was take-home, and had around 10-11 questions that required paragraph responses with a short essay at the end of the exam. At the end of the quarter, she got rid of the final and instead posted an essay for us to do. She did not provide the promised feedback on everyone's essays until a few days before it was due. If you do end up taking her class, just know that your final grade will be a toss-up, because even if you ask her questions and go to her office hours, the prof will not give you a clear answer about anything.

The quizzes, midterm, and final will be testing you on vocabulary and the conjugations that you learn in class - it really just takes practice and are literally taken from lecture. Make sure you know the spelling! There are vowels that sound the same but are spelled differently - the only way to learn the difference is to remember it. The only \"difficult\" thing might be the group project. We have a choice to do a skit in class or through a video, so a majority did the video. As Korean 1, you only learn the very basic grammatical structures, so the video, if a more fun/creative idea (ex: Kdrama parodies), it requires you to speak in sentences we wouldn't have been able to learn. Using Google translate would probably be okay but it'd be obvious and wouldn't sound too great to the professor. The professor is super lenient with the video so just have fun with it. Filming and editing does take a while so I'd recommend to start early. It's a pretty fun class, would recommend it if you're not sure which language to take.",

There are no midterms or finals, just a 6 page paper at the end of the quarter detailing a course schedule for your next few years at UCR. Just turn in your discussion assignments on time and do well on the paper. I ended the class with an A+. ",

Just a website, a short paper, and a video about a topic of your choice. Lectures are interesting and all of the readings and material is helpful. Takes long to respond to emails, haven't received a grade yet for anything though. I would take this professor again as he is very nice and helpful.",

You'll be lost if you don't go to lecture because the textbook doesn't explain things in detail as the professor does.

Attendance was 10% of our grade, one midterm and a final, along with discussion and participation counting for 20% from what I remember. We were given case briefs that were due weekly and were fairly easy and took about an hour total to complete. When I took the course again in Summer 2022, I had Soofia Lateef and she did an excellent job! Her class was structured the same as Cranor\u2019s. She answered all your questions, made lecture slides available, and was very clear about the topics discussed. We talked about tort law, criminal law, and admin law only due to the 5 week condensed summer course. I also had a very fun and helpful TA! Only drawback to the course is that you have to purchase the textbook that Professor Cranor wrote himself which was around $90. ",

After first 3 weeks, don't bother going to lectures, especially if you have Tran, the worksheets he goes over are useless. You're basically taking precalc in another language, nothing you google will make sense since everything is abstract and made up by Weisbart. Final is 50% of grade, however you're basically guaranteed the other 50%, and you only need 40% on final to pass if that's all you care about.\n\nI highly recommend skipping lectures, and instead use all the time to watch the videos and practice over and over the hw exercises and midterm practices. Doing this got me an A+ since the final was easy. Don't fall behind, this class is harder to fail than it is to pass.",

Isn't hard to get an A, so long as your on top of the material and study like one to two hours a week outside of class and homework.

If you took Calc AB in hs, this is mainly a review w a few new tricks on familiar concepts. Homework is weekly and kind of a bother bc the system can be picky about \"correct\" answers. For instance, it often does not recognize answers that are equivalent to its own so you kind of have to solve problems very formally. Weekly quizzes in discussion, but the TAs do a great job of walking you through the concept and then quizzing you at the end of discussion. Tests aren't too bad",

I had Dr. Chen, and he was great. He gave us enough time to do homework problems and they were not long. The homework problems are more complex than those on the exams which I think is good because you will be prepared for the exams. The averages were about 80-85%. The midterms (2) and final are all free-response and must be worked out and turned in via Gradescope. As far as proctoring, he required us to log into zoom and have our cameras on and no calculators allowed. He also did offer one extra credit quiz. DOWNSIDE: He only uploads his notes that he takes during the live lecture but does not record the actual lecturing. However, he does upload example videos of him going through various problems for the modules.",

He's a fast lecturer where he talks fast and sometimes do shortcuts during lecture examples without explanation as he may expects you to be familiarize with the learnings of 7A materials. All his lecture notes are just examples of the problems of the contents he'll be teaching. There's still online hw with unlimited amount of attempts to pass. Microtutorials are also there, but Zhang won't include the qs related to the microtutorial vids in the exams. Exams were quite average with some mostly doable and others a bit diffcult/tricky. Weekly discussion quizzes are based on the optional textbook problems that he'll give as part of extra practice. His office hours were very helpful as he'll help you try solve any calc problems (hw, exam, quiz) you may have experience with. Overall, I get the sense that he's trying his best to help you succeed despite the difficulties of the content and the way he teaches which he's an okay professor. I would suggest that you keep practicing the materials and try understand the process of the materials when solving them! ",

So try to get him if you take this course :) In terms of content, if you're a freshman and you didn't take any AP Calc courses but placed into this, its definitely gonna be overwhelming. There's always gonna be kids who know more than you since they had more experience with it. You can do well even if you procrastinate but beware that it's a LOT of cramming. Make sure you study for the quizzes because it's easy to forget considering how much we have to remember. Be attentive during lecture, you miss one thing and can get lost and then needa rewatch it.

Just review the homework questions by finishing them in a spread out manner, then reviewing them the day before the test. It is not a hard class to get an A in.

A lot of this course isn\u2019t even calculus, and there\u2019s barely any integration so being bad at calculus isn\u2019t really a death knell.

Also go to his office hours, he gave someone (who always went to his OH) extra credit on the midterm even though he never mentioned that extra credit was possible.

Honestly I was initially very worried going into discrete math for the first time (it was also my first quarter at UCR as well) but all doubts were relieved the first week into the quarter. His teaching style is very intuitive and I really liked his attitude throughout. I very rarely had to consult the textbook, since he is very open to helping clarify any unclear info about the course material. He also records lectures and his course was hybrid, but I would still recommend going in-person anyway. As long as you pay attention in class you should do fine on homework assignments and midterms/finals. Topics include number theory, set theory, propositional logic, and mapping.",

Most of the videos only had one question you had to answer, but there were a few with more. You could retry the question as many times as you wanted though and the correct answer was usually given to you if you answered the question wrong twice, so there was really no reason, not to get 100% in this section. There were also optional videos that could earn you up to 10% extra credit. There were 4 quizzes throughout the course. The quizzes were out of 10 points and each quiz was worth 10% of your grade. These quizzes were impossible to pass if you didn't do any form of studying. The final was multiple choice and worth 20% of your grade. Not too difficult and not too easy, but just like the quizzes, impossible to pass if you didn't do any studying.\nThe class overall, wasn't too difficult, but a lot of the concepts felt \"foreign\" and even when I did get the right answer in a quiz, I never felt confident when I was writing the answer. Javier is a good professor, and know this because this wasn't my first time having him as a professor, but I feel like this course wasn't his strong suit, and at times he couldn't really explain some of the concepts to the best of his ability. Still, he was accomadating and would push back due dates on videos and quizzes if he felt that people would be falling behind, and made this weird course feel a little bit easier.",

I never took Calc in high school, so learning new, sometimes difficult content at a quarter system pace was challenging. For someone who's taken Calc before, this class is a breeze. It just depends on which category you fall in. There is HOURS of homework, and the quizzes can sometimes be difficult if you don't do the study guides he assigns. I will stress this--Do the study guides--the quizzes are nearly exactly like study guide questions and you also benefit by getting additional practice. The reason why there is so much work is because practice really does determine your success in this class. He gives out an extremely detailed Midterm and Final Exam, you know almost exactly how many questions and what type of questions you will be tested on. In addition, he also gives out sample final and midterms and the questions are nearly always the same. Going to ARC Math022 tutoring and his office hours were helpful. This class gets a lot of negative reviews because a lot of people don't go out of their way to advocate for themselves and expect a good grade to just be handed without putting in the work. If you are willing to put in extra work and all the homework/study guides, go to tutoring/office hours---this class is extremely manageable. ",

I honestly believe that he is a very fair teacher and he genuinely wants his students to understand the material and succeed. As someone who has not taken a calc class before, I had to make sure I worked hard and understood everything from the previous lecture before each new lecture. Homework can be time consuming, but it is really not bad. Make sure to give yourself enough time to complete each homework assignment so you don't stress about it the night it is due! Also, attend office hours, discussion TAs and Curtis holds really helpful ones. There are 2 midterms and 1 final. Midterms are about 16% and final is 32% of your grade. He gives several free points on each test depending on how well the class does overall. Math 22 is a bit easier than typical calc classes because it does not go too in depth in any topic and there's no trig. However, there will be useful business application problems. It was not too difficult if you advocate for yourself and put in the work to succeed. I was nervous for this class, but it ended up being my best class experience and I ended up with a grade I am proud of. ",

Learn how to row-reduce matrices and you\u2019ve pretty much got the \u201cmath\u201d portion of the class figured out. The rest is conceptually based, and you will have to figure out how to classify systems of equations or matrices based off how the pivots look in the matrix. The course weights are pretty lenient for the most part: for HW there are infinitely many attempts for you to get a problem right, and there are two midterms (but instructor drops the lowest one). The final exam is worth 40% of your grade. I got over 100% but again, the professor weighs her course such that a 90% is an A and an 85% is an A-, so there will usually always be extra opportunities for struggling students.

Chen's programming assignments were more difficult, but you'll have around two weeks to do them, so you should be fine if you start early and go to office hours for help.

Quizzes and a group project make up a solid percentage of your grade so no need to fret. He assigns HW often but you probably only turn in two packets at most, but the HW is on par with ripping teeth out of your skull with pliers. Its tough to do and will leave you with a massive headache after attempting and failing at the same proof of convergence in L2 space. Pay attention, ask questions, and above all do not bullshit on your project. The man is not afraid to tear you a new in front of your peers and has a in depth knowledge of physics as well as math so he will call you out.

They were made up of problems from the book and problems he gave during lecture and we weren't required to do all of them.

Be sure to take notes during lecture because he doesn't post his online. Also, I went to every lecture and discussion but apparently that wasn't enough to get full points for attendance and participation. My final grade was a B.

He summarized the lectures that made it easier to understand since the professor would ramble about the readings. They expect you to do the reading prior to attending class because she would talk about then. She also posts the slides about the reading before class. There was a midterm, weekly discussion posts for the discussion section and 2 discussion posts for the actual class, and a final paper. However, the other TA, Mallory, had assigned additional things sometimes like a quiz. Overall it's not too bad if you can remember the terms and events in Media. The midterm is based on what was taught, whereas the final paper was on a topic assigned by the professor based on a recent event in media.

Having accurate solutions helped in two ways: one, saved my homework grade and, two, gave me the right answers to study from when it came to the exam time. Midterm 1, 4/5 problems were seen previously in either homework or quizzes. Midterm 2, 3/5 problems were seen already. Go to office hours to check if your solutions are 100% correct, so you don't miss any points on the exam. Outside of his lectures, you should start applying the principles in the real world and think, \"what are the forces acting on this system?\" or \"Why does this work/built this way?\".

It is not an intro class and the level of programming is intermediate to advanced. Learn Python before taking this class.\n\nCoding labs will suck out so much time in your schedule. You'll think the first lab is easy and it's alright, pretty straightforward, but it climbs in difficulty. For example, you have to program recursive sequences without being taught what is recursion. Note that you cant use in-built tools on MATLAB and you have to create these tools through code.\n\nPray you'll pass the class if Sundar or Stahovich is teaching it. Hardest engineering class I've taken at this school. I took the class with Sundar teaching.\n\nSundar lectures decently, but his exams, coding assignments, coding final, was on a whole different level. When it came to coding for the labs and projects he would concoct the most insanely difficult assignment to do. Sundar will work you into the ground if you want to succeed in not just this class, but any ME class he teaches.\n\nI believe that Sundar does care to some degree but he is incredibly harsh when it comes to grading. Often he doesn't reply to emails. Honestly even stressful talking to him.",

You really need to understand the theorem, not just the formulas, or you will fail the class. You will have homework every week -- do not slack off on these. The homework will help you understand the material on the exams (2 midterms and 1 final). There are also quizzes almost every week in discussion. In addition, there was a project due at the end of the quarter. Start the project early cause it's something you can not procrastinate. In fact, a majority of the class didn't finish the project.

The TAs were super super helpful and she does leave out some of the details of what u should include in ur lab reports, hw, etc. but her passion for this subject is pretty cool pretty easy tech elective if u know how to set expressions given a diagram (sometimes she doesnt really tell u what ur solving for or what variables to use for said expressions but it's ok that's what makes this class pretty easy) if i can get an A in this class so can u. also like 2/3 of the class stopped showing up after the midterm (myself included ofc) bc honestly we only had 2 genuine lectures and never again since every lecture got turned into a lab time lol the only thing u have to worry about are finals tbh bc midterms count just as much as this quiz thing that ur guaranteed 100% on and lab reports are iffy depending on her mood or the number of people that complained about it for an extension or something i recommend easy tech elective fr oh and if ur bad at coding pls dont ask her to take the final online bc she doesnt really teach u lines of code ur expected to know :)",

There is a final presentation that you have to do that can be presented for extra credit or turned in without presenting. It is much better to present since you get the option to have questions from your selected artist to be showcased in the final exam. There are listening parts to the exam that is best done by taking time listening to the examples required every week. There are plenty of extra credit options, but show up to lectures because attendance is a huge part of your grade (a whole letter in fact). Presentation lectures will not be posted on iLearn so take notes and read the book.

Sometimes there is demonstrations of the instruments and you get to play some in discussion. 3 listening quizzes (online), final paper on a concert you attended, and final exam. Try not to procrastinate on the final paper. Ask TA's for help if needed since they will be grading the essay. Go to lecture and take good notes since you can use them for the quizzes (open note). Extra credit is also offered towards the end if you haven't been doing good on the tests. Would definitely recommend taking this course. I would take again.",

It's not that the material was difficult to comprehend, it's that there's 4 quizzes in the class and each has 15 questions and is worth fifteen percent of your grade. So getting a few questions wrong means you're screwed. And it's pretty easy to mess up since some questions are based on memory of what an artist looks like or a certain part of a song out of a required 30 songs that are required.

I have a few complaints. 1. There is a lot of reading. They are mostly 5-10pg articles and they average about 7 different articles A WEEK. The exams are reading heavy so you have to read the articles to do well. 2. The TAs are absolutely useless. It sucks enough that all lectures are recorded so you have no contact with the professor. My TA took an average of 1 week to respond to my emails, which would be too late anyway. The only actual class time is during discussion and most of the TAs for this class will straight up say to not ask them about the material because they don't have time to look at it. For exams, they tell you to do the reading, give you a study guide of what they think will be on the exam and call it a day. 2. There are 4 midterms and 1 final exam. Basically, there is an exam every other week on Fridays, so be careful about what classes you might have on Fridays. 4. The assignments are tedious and boring and the TAs grade harshly for things like citations, grammar, word count, etc. If you go over or under the word requirement, you will get points deducted. 5. The professors are not empathetic. A peer of mine got sick with covid and was in the hospital. When they let the professor know since they missed an assignment, the professor said that they should have told him sooner and the student received a 0 on the assignment. Good things about the course: 1. open-note exams 2. recorded lectures if that's your thing 3. Sometimes curves exam scores. 4. They drop your lowest exam score. (somehow got an A, but still. Good luck lol)",

This class is basically Busywork: The Class, and I would strongly, STRONGLY advise against taking this class if you don't need to. I took this class for credits, and the amount of time I had to put into this class was ridiculous. I ended up having to put more time in this class than the other two classes I took this quarter combined. The grading for this class is based around biweekly exams (that's 5 exams total - 5!!) that are open-book, but because they are open-book, the professor takes that as an excuse to grill you on minute details of the readings assigned for that week. Readings are pretty lengthy, and on top of doing readings as well as studying for each of the 5 exams, you are also given writing assignments that progressively get longer on creating your own public policy. I did fine on these writing assignments, as well as the exams. It feels like you only have to do the bare minimum to succeed in this class, but the bare minimum is still a ridiculous amount of time.

All lectures were asynchronous, 1 in-person discussion section a week. No tests, no finals. There were two 5-6 page papers and weekly journal assignments (3-4 questions). The grading is a little confusing, but basically the more work you do the likelier you will have a good grade. There are no books to buy, everything is supplied with PDFs. TA\u2019s are really important, my TA was wonderful and explained things well and helped us with everything. In general, if you keep up with the assignments and double check your ideas/thesis statements with the TA before writing papers you will get an A. Not a difficult class. Also, asynchronous lectures & readings can be skimmed as long as you can do the journal assignments well. \n\nPre-requisite is Eng 1a and 1b. This is an English 1c class. Need to be good at forming ideas, actual writing is not as complicated.",

Kim structures the class with more complicated material upfront and less complicated stuff towards the end so you don't get burnt out.

If you want to pass the class with an A which is 100% possible, start off strong and go to office hours starting week 2 before your first exam. There is a test every week so go to office hours every week because everything is built ontop of everything so if you dont understand something from a previous week it will harm you the entire quarter.

No exams, only four papers (the first one was optional). How well you did in the class depended on your TA since they're the only one who read your essays. I had John Green, and he was nice but graded ruthlessly. General consensus was that TA's liked papers that were concise and straightforward.",

He's a great professor and lectures very clearly so that the material (which can be sometimes challenging) is broken down into simple concepts. You're going to write two papers, with the first paper being 10% of your grade and the second paper being 15%, but both are only 1.5 pages long. The midterm was easy for me and I anticipate the final on being equally simple. On his exams, he dedicates 5 questions for you to explain your previous answers and, if he thinks they're acceptable explanations, you will be able to earn the points back if you missed the question. Overall, pretty enjoyable experience; I would take him again.",

IMO a decent professor, but the lectures were pretty dry and boring at times. 4 open-book quizzes ONLINE worth 5pts each (20% of grade), along with 2 essays (first is 3pgs, worth 10%, next is 5pgs, worth 30%). He posts the lecture notes on ilearn, but I recommend going to lecture because he breaks down all the confusing concepts/explains pretty well. Just do the readings ahead of time, go to discussion (TAKE IT WITH ANDREW LAW, bc he really helps clarify everything; I understood the material more when he explained it than when the professor did lol). Passed with an A, but you definitely need to put in some work to get an A in the class. Forgot to mention: on the final, you get to bring a cheat sheet (1 page handwritten) with anything you want to write down: Prof Harmer distributes the essay questions for the final a week before, so you can just write down your final essay on that piece of paper walk in and copy it down on the final exam.",

I have no interest in Philosophy and was only taking it because it's a requirement, so I found the class boring majority of the time. Class is reading heavy, but he breaks them down really well during lectures and in my experience, my TA did well on breaking them down during discussions (mandatory) too. 3 quizzes, 2 papers, 1 final. For the quizzes, the questions ask you to find a specific quote from the readings and explain them, so read closely! The papers aren't too bad and he gives you a lot of time to finish them; make sure to go to office hours if you need help. The final wasn't too bad; there were mc questions, free response questions, a long answer question. He gives out the long answer question a couple of weeks ahead and also allows a double-sided cheat sheet. Due to certain circumstances, the final was online and not the normal in-person style.",

He's a very unorganized professor that likes to randomly change the homework and lectures at will. If you didn't take PHIL008, I hear it was very difficult and troublesome to pick up the course content because they assume you know PHIL008 stuff from Week 0. Nothing from PHIL008 is reviewed, they just assume you already know it and they move on with the schedule.\nThe course involves 9 homeworks (assigned every single week starting from Week 2 to Week 10), two midterms and a final. It also has a bunch of in-class quizzes involved (to incentivize people to come in at 8AM I guess?), some \"improvement\" score that's worth 5% of your grade and discussion attendance is mandatory. If you miss discussion, your OVERALL course grade gets docked 4% every single time if you don't have a valid excuse. \nCourse content includes semantic proofs, main operator identification, truth tables, countermodels, logical consequence, propositional logic (AND / OR / IF, THEN / NEGATION, etc), quantificational logic (For All, There Exists, etc), and A LOT of derivations. Like, A LOT of derivations. If you took PHIL008 then you know how the derivations go; they basically just build on the derivations from PHIL008 and added some new operators for propositional logic. In the last few weeks, they'll teach you how to do quantificational logic derivations which is much more difficult but manageable.",

The real pain in the butt is that if you fail any one of his three exams, you fail the class. IMO it is a ridiculous system and puts a lot of unnecessary stress on the students. I hated it.

You get 12 attempts per problems which is quite a lot, but there will be qs that are either hard to approach, or you may have to think more carefully about it with different approach. Peng may stop at different part of the lecture and the lecture homework may not correlate to his lecture progress. In terms of getting help from the office hours, Peng is very helpful with the materials and the homework problems along with TAs' office hour as well. His exam were quite mixed. He only has one midterm with mostly conceptual questions from the lecture materials and clicker qs with few quantitative problems. You have 12 qs but can pick 10 qs to count for full grade. For his final, it's half qualitative based on lecture materials and clicker qs while other half are mostly quantitative materials mostly from the hardest hw problems you might encountered. So overall, please do pay attention to his lecture as he doesn't record them, and seek office hours whenever you're struggling and they will def. help you succeed. ",

It also helps to ask the TA for certain sections in the lab. In addition, final assessment was done online (as a timed iLearn exam). Honestly, if you are well prepared for the lecture and know how to do the labs, you should be able to ace the final exam. P.S. You are allowed to use your lab notebook during quizzes and the final assessment, so write down those formulas and concepts if you need it (as a cheat sheet). :) ",

Pre-lab assignments were mid, some are easy while others are hard. It depends on the TA, you might either have a good TA or bad TA that can influence your lab grade. LSA final is pretty tough as it doesn't reflect what you originally thought would be similar to the pre-lab quizzes. You get to use your lab notebook, but there will be chances on the LSA where they might asked you different qs that you didn't accounted/pay attention for during lab or the pre-lab assignments. I suggest write down all the equations and how would you solve for a particular variable within the equation along with all the potential concepts understanding from the labs. ",

Honestly, the content itself isn't that difficult, but the prof expects so much of you as a student. The exams and quizzes were super unreasonable and difficult, and even the TAs said that, too. He didn't even give us a formula sheet. The TAs said they were going to try and do something about how difficult he makes this class, but I am not sure what or if it will work. If you can avoid him and don't mind spending 10 weeks on a physics class, I would recommend taking the class at a different time with a different prof. If you can't avoid him, I would suggest reading each chapter before the lecture and doing the homework way early on so you can ask questions at office hours. The best way to study for exams is to review quizzes and discussion worksheets, because there's a lot of similar themes since he writes his own questions. Even though he curved the midterm, quizzes, polls, and the final exam grades by A LOT, the midterm average was a ~39% and the final exam average was 49-50%. 71.5% was the cutoff for an A, and passing was a 40%.

Also do make sure to understand vectors, dot product, and cross product as they're important for the lecture materials and exams. The exams are multiple choices. I would say go over the lecture materials, PollEverywhere Questions, and homework problems for extra practices and preparations for his exams.

Quite a few problems were similar to practice exams and it was not difficult to do well in the class as long as you know how to do practice exam questions and the lecture examples. A lot of it is just knowing how to use the formulas/equations, so sometimes just knowing how to do math can help you solve the problems! Since the exams are on the easier side, he doesn't curve much so 90 = A, 75 = B, and 60 = C, but if averages are low, he may change the cutoffs slightly. The professor you take for physics in general will determine how well you do since some professors give more difficult exams, but will curve or adjust cutoffs accordingly.",

There's lecture participation in the form of PollEverywhere, but you're only required to do about 80% of the them to get full credit, so you safely miss two or three lectures throughout the quarter. Every week we get a Homework assignment, but you don't really have to do it as your TA in discussions go over the answers with the class. At the end of discussion you're given a quiz, which are just three questions from the Homework assignment, meaning they're quizzes you can easily get 100% on every single time. Then there's three exams. All of them are 10 questions long, online, and open-note, which makes them pretty easy. Only reason you should get a bad score in the exams is if you don't know how to navigate through your notes or the textbook. Now she decided this halfway through the course, but only two highest scoring exams will go into your grade, making this class even easier. Not to mention, she also offers 5% worth of extra credit where all you have to do is say one good thing about the week's lectures and one bad thing.\n\nTLDR: Easy class if taken with Sales ",

Topics covered largely resemble AP Physics 1 curriculum from kinematics all the way up to rotational motion.

Make sure to go to his office hours in order to get any clarifications sorted out. If you also have Boerge, he basically covers 99% of the material from the textbook so you do not really have to read (although he will quiz you some concepts from the textbook during clickers).\nIn terms of the class, if you suffered through 40A, you will definitely suffer through 40B. The midterm was fairly simple, as it only covered about three chapters, but the final will definitely kill everyone's grade (however, it is not cumulative).\nDiscussions are mandatory and there was a quiz every class -- something not mentioned in the syllabus. According to my TA, 50% of one's discussion grade is based off attendance and the other 50% is based off the quiz grades.\nClickers were not based off participation -- something that is different from 40A.

For example this quarter(winter 2018) he somehow combined pistons, ideal gases, heat of vaporization, and thermodynamics into a single fucking question. Even if you understand the physics behind all these concepts perfectly, his questions feel like a puzzle. As far as I can tell, the other two professors make extremely \"easy\" straightforward questions and the curve is usually pretty nice. \n\nIn the past, you would want to avoid Mills because he makes the hardest questions and he doesn't teach that well but now that all the professors are making the final, it might actually be beneficial to have him as a professor because you could get used to his madness before the final.

The MasteringPhysics signup code wasn't posted until Wednesday of Week 2, and after it was posted, it got changed twice until it was finally the correct one. The syllabus originally had a 10% grading category for Poll Everywhere (clicker questions), but it got removed and the 10% was added to the midterms instead, which ended up making the midterms worth more than the final exam. Our TA said that the class average on the 2nd midterm was about a 55%, but Dr. Nouri never confirmed that the midterm grades would be curved or scaled. Personally, I scored well above the class average on that midterm, although it was in no part due to Dr. Nouri's instruction. I believe that I only did well because I put effort into the assignments, went to every discussion, and attended SI sessions. \n\nAlso, starting from halfway into the quarter, I began attending Dr. Wei's (the other professor for PHYS040B) lectures instead, and as a result I understood the content much better. Compared to Dr. Nouri's slides, Dr. Wei's were much better at helping me learn the material, and my notes were much more detailed after switching. Most importantly, Dr. Wei's slides were adequately annotated, whereas Dr. Nouri wouldn't even provide solutions to the example problems in his slides. On multiple occasions, I was confused on an assignment, and after finding Dr. Nouri to be unhelpful, I got a better answer from a TA. \n\nOverall, I definitely wouldn't recommend Dr. Nouri for anyone planning to take PHYS040B, and I strongly urge the Physics department to reconsider having him in a teaching position.",

If you have, then it is more like a 5 to 6 - you'll be fine. The core of the difficulty for you will be the workload: daily lectures, \ndaily HW assignments, long lab reports, group project, python work, alongside it being a bit more difficult than your highschool Physics class. But if you're like me, and didn't have prior exposure.. oh boy, this class is gonna be a challenge if you want an A. \n\nYou will have to juggle the same workload as the others, only you're going to have to be learning the material at the same time! The lectures that you will have in class largely serve to support the concepts you already know, which is fine for the rest of the students, but you will have to read the textbook to learn the material for the first time before you get any real use from them, and if you don't, they will serve little immediate benefit to you as they don't properly \"teach\" you. That means that you will have to read around 14 chapters from the textbook that everyone else won't have to, and then immediately apply it within the same week, as there are weekly quizzes. I hope you're passionate, because you'll need to be if you you're going without some background already. \n\nWith all that being said, that's if you want the A, which you should since it's 8 units and will have a considerable impact on your GPA. There is thankfully a pretty curve at the end that saves a lot of people. So don't be too scared. It's a fair class. ",

Homework sets were set by leve i.e. CH14-1 (\"easy\" homework) CH14-2 (harder homework). 2 labs a week, they were not bad, but required a lot of work. Quizzes were every Monday on the chapters we covered in the week. No midterm, the quiz scores determined you grade, if you fall below 40% You will get an email to either drop, change majors/class, or stay. The final was exactly like the homework question, but some where not. During class hours we worked on homework problems, he did not lecture, reverse classroom setting.

(The instructor was Professor Tom.)\n\nFor the quizzes, there is 10 quiz total, a quiz for each week except week one, and two of them at week 10. You will be asked 3 questions on your homework/lab, and as long as you get one right, you'll get a full score. He sometimes even goes over the questions before the quiz. \n\nThis class is hard for two reasons: one, too much content within too short time. Two, it's really a jump from \"Oh I know all those, kind of associated with common knowledge\" (PHYS041A) to \"I actually gotta learn and participate in classes\". \n\nThis is probably the class I had the most fun in, if not because I got really sick and had to skip two weeks of class, it would be an easy A+ (80%)",

Daily reading quizzes are fair and homework and quizzes are fairly easy (and fair lol). The midterm will kill a great portion of the class. Since it was his first time teaching a lot of us were unprepared for the difficulty of the midterm, but aside from that the material itself is okay (you will need to sit and think about it though).\n\nQuantum physics (2nd half) hurts. It makes no sense, and everything is counterintuitive. The textbook is exceedingly complicated and the homework problems are often never going to show on quizzes or the final (a few essential ones did but you will be able to tell what those are). By the way, Dr. Long's quizzes and final are based almost entirely on lecture notes (which he posts), but if you are cool with going to lecture, do so from time to time as sometimes some of the things he says reflects what you could see on a quiz.\n\n\nThe math gets so complicated you will need to use Mathematica. You literally only do that so you can get homework points smh. This class will force you to constantly ask the most fundamental of questions only for you to still be confused. Good luck!",

It's actually not that long if you do it on a daily bases (so you won't get shout at \"DO THE READINGS DUDE\" and Anson won't need to scratch his head because no one in the class watched the lecture XD).\n\nImportant note: do the hw and understand them, really important.

He doesn't understand that many people in the class aren't concentrated in astro; they are other types of physics majors in the class.  He only has office hours an hour per week. His homework assignments aren't the easiest to do as well; you'll have to do some digging in the textbook. He doesn't do any example problems in class so that's where you'll struggle too.

Ridiculously easy, her quizzes are graded by completion, not performance, you can just speed run through the quiz and still get 100%.  Her mid-term and final was open book and was not proctored, both were extremely easy.  The class only gets difficult if you have a TA that assigns quizzes on the readings every week, I got lucky and got a chill ass TA (she never assigned quizzes).  Shout out to Bea-Sim!",

If you did both, they would count for 40% each but if you only did one it would count for 80% of your grade. Participation was also 20% of your grade. He also told the class that if you wanted more assignments to count towards your grade, you can just email him and ask. We studied the social contract theory and 7 of its theorists: Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Rawls, Mills, Pateman, and Fanon. The class was super interesting to me and whenever I attended class, people would have great discussions even if opinions differed. His midterm and final review are pretty self explanatory and quite literally tell you step by step how to write an essay that would get you an A. I only did the final and never participated hence why I got a B+ in the class, but I\u2019m pretty sure if you participate and put a little more effort than I did, it would be an easy A class!",

It goes from learning about absolute/comparative advantage to contemporary strategies of economic development (and their rationale).

As someone with bad study habits, this class was extremely tedious. It isn't necessarily hard material, it's just a lot. Skipping a lecture or not reading and waiting to catch up later is something that will bite you in the butt. Good and bad thing about the grading - it's only based on the midterm, a policy paper, participation (attending discussion) and the final. There was one extra credit opportunity which was just attending a seminar that counted for 10 points in participation. The midterm and final are the same format. Not sure if the same method of the midterm and final was done in previous years, but for Fall 2019, it was 4 ID questions and 1 essay question for the midterm and 2 for the final. She didn't tell us how many words she was going to put for the exams beforehand so we had to make sure we knew all the vocabulary (20+ words for midterm, then cumulative for final) and the essay questions (midterm ~8, final ~12). It seemed pretty overwhelming since other classes would usually tell you how many choices they're going to give you. She gave us 5 choices for IDs and made us write a paragraph of its definition and why the concept is important for 4 of them. If you tend to skip lecture, which I really don't recommend, you should always go to discussion. There's only one TA and he's super helpful. This was basically what made me pass the class. Honestly wouldn't recommend the class if you're a business major looking for electives to take, unless the reading and grading of it appeals to you (as in, no homework but the midterm and final will matter a lot more).

She posts all her slides and records lectures, and all quizzes and exams are open book. Nearly impossible to do bad in this class! She also randomly will do polls in class that can earn you extra credit if you do them! Best polisci professor ever :)",

Chapter in the textbook every week (although you don't really have to but the textbook is super interactive so it was very easy to read), Quizzes for every chapter (but you can just keep going till you get 100%, questions are unlimited), and then an assignment every week (but it was lowk busy work, only takes about 20 minutes). At the beginning of the week she also sends out what should be done for the week which is superrr helpful. Oh and media project at the end (I just did a tiktok and got a 102%, super easy) and UCR research hours (just participate in a study) Take this class!!! You'll enjoy it. Got an A+",

His presentations lacked information but I honestly forced myself to go and he explains everything well. Exams/quizzes are all fair game, just don't be lazy. I got an A in it (when I was full well expecting a C- based off what people were telling me) and can definitely say that attendance is super important for him. He also is super humble in what he knows and what he doesn't know :) Just be ready to remember important concepts and what he shows on the slides but as long as you understand lecture, you can definitely get an A!!",

Unlike most other professors, those of us who had to get a job/extra jobs during school because of the pandemic weren't accommodated in terms of participation we had to miss (and it was 25% of final grade). He was also really inconsiderate about money, for example he said that a $50 2nd textbook cost couldn't be waived but it's \"just a fraction of your tuition anyway\" (he also mentioned during this announcement that people told him they were struggling to afford food/rent and he basically responded with \"That sucks but I can't do anything about it,\" it was unbelievable).

The concepts are interesting. BUT: you have a lot of assignments, and TA's were pretty tough graders. there are two exams (midterm and final), 10 extra credit quizzes, weekly discussion assignments (weeks 2-3, weeks 4-5, and weeks 8-9 were the three toughest ones, and weeks 8-9 was 20% of your grade). Lectures are not mandatory to attend, but lecture attendance does count towards your grade and she checks using PollEv. If you are unable to make it to lecture, you had the option to write at least 2 pages of handwritten notes to make up for it. \nExams were pretty tricky, you cannot just memorize the concepts, you have to apply them as well. Both exams are 5 short answers. \nOverall, amazing and accommodating professor! But tricky concepts, and lots of assignments.",

Weekly polls during each lecture for attendance. Recordings are available if you can't make it to class. All you have to do is submit your notes from the lecture that day to get participation points for the lecture. For the \"midterm\" there is a few essay questions to answer (you could use your notes, wasn't really an actual test). A few APA style write ups and data analysis during discussion, nothing too hard. The final consists of a portfolio where you put in all the coursework you did and prove why you think you deserve the grade. Here's the best part...YOU GET TO GRADE YOURSELF. There isn't really a point system. Trust me, you can't necessarily get away with just assigning yourself an A, you need to prove that. SO PUT IN EFFORT. ITS WORTH IT. You will learn a lot from this course and overall it is a fun class to learn about. Even if you turn in an assignment late, you can justify it in your portfolio to make up for \"missed points\" which at the same time doesn't count against you. Just trust me, TAKE IT WITH DITTA. She's literally the best teacher, and I learned so much in her class where I actually wanted to do more than what she required. We need more teachers like her for sure! Good luck!",

Basically, you have a choice whether or not you want to take a midterm. If you do decide to take all three, the lowest score of whatever midterm you took is dropped. Midterms were pretty easy. First midterm I didn't study much and ended up with a C on it, but I studied more for the other 2 midterms by going over lecture notes and reading the textbook (but only to get more detail on lecture content), and I got an A on the 2nd midterm and a perfect score on the 3rd. We had to write a max 8 page paper on a book (very interesting book!), and another paper on a movie (an amazing movie). Lectures were mandatory to attend since she took attendance using PollEv (but there were time where she didn't do polls). Discussions were required to attend, but you basically go over class content.\nProfessor Natsuaki herself is a gem. Really sweet person, did her best (and did an amazing job) to accommodate this sudden transition to in-person. She knows that the topics she discusses in class are really sensitive, so she explained the concepts well.\nYour TA's grade the two papers you do (movie and book). How tough the grading is depends on your TA. My TA was a pretty harsh grader. I put a lot of effort onto the two papers and got an 80% in the movie paper and 90% on the book paper. One of the other TA's though (Erick) I heard was great. He's supposedly funny, and a hella laid back grader. Also he's pretty close to Professor Natsuaki since he's TA'd for her I wanna say 5 times.\nOverall: Do you have to put in the work? Yes. If you do- you're guaranteed an A (hence the 5/10 rating because it depends on you).",

Even if the material was relatively easy, the workload was sometimes insurmountable in terms of reading and assignments - this is one of those classes where the professor acts like it's your only class and you don't have 2 or 3 others you're also doing readings and writing papers for. Dr. Lucia obviously knows what she's talking about and is esteemed in her field but sometimes acts as though we should already know half of the information she is presenting to us. She picks favorites and can be quite condescending. We also spent like 2 weeks on Native American religion but only 2 on Hinduism/Buddhism combined - of course there's only so much you can teach in 10 weeks but I felt that a lot of it was fairly disproportionate for a class about myth and ritual. Lecture was alright but discussion was based on Socratic seminar which I absolutely hated because attendance and participation (ie. speaking) were mandatory. If you have to take this class then just do as many of the readings as you can early so you don't shoot yourself in the foot later in the quarter before the final.",

Easy C if you just review the google docs before the midterms, but if you want a B or an A, you need to read and actually know the concepts as her test were not definition based but were more conceptual in terms of applying your knowledge to real life examples and context.  I got a B, and I read every chapter and attended all the lectures. She is funny AF, so thats always a positive of attending lecture. Does not post lecture slides, but can get them if you make friends. Otherwise a good and insightful class to take, but reading is required for a good grade.",

Gives practice questions that end up word for word on the actual exam and even watched a movie that gave free points. Easy extra credit is also possible at the end of the quarter.

You have to actively participate during Zoom and turn on your camera. He takes attendance. The class consists of using McGraw broken down into 8 sections and everyday (Mon-Thur) the assignment deadline is due the next day before class starts instead of 11:59pm. There\u2019s also chapter quizzes based on the homework and textbook. Two writing compositions during class time. Midterm is an individual oral presentation. I feel like this class was way easier than high school but I tend to forget everything so it was basically a review course but also relearning what I forgot. He wasn\u2019t mean or rude like I hear about the other Spanish professors. The class was chill. Take him if you can! If you know more on speaking Spanish then this class would be easy for you. ",

Pretty much daily homework assignments (30 minutes max), 2 short essays, 4 quizzes, two oral assessments (1 presentation, and 1 conversation), and then an online final in the same format as the quizzes/homework.

Workload is ridiculous for a lower division class, and is more in line with an upper division class. Homework mainly consists of particiation activities such as filling in the blanks, readings, and auditory exercises. This would be fine if there weren't up to 150 probelms due daily.  Even when doing all homework activities and taking thorough notes, expect to get a 70% on the exams, which there are 4 of during the quarter.\nProfessor Navarro is a strict professor during lecture, and grades harshly. Navarro also has a tendency to be rude to his own students, and inconsiderate of students' hardships despite going through his own.\nDo not take this class with Navarro, and, if possible, waive the requirement for this class until Navarro changes his attitude or is replaced with another professor. If you are currently taking this class, I highly recommend leaving a harsh iEval at the end of the quarter.",

Our grades were A/+- and B/+-, depending on whether you are in the upper tile or lower tile in the class. Like hell, does this even make sense? Why should other students play in my and your grade? We didn't even know this from the beginning. And some questions were not discussed in his lecture. Our final question points = final total points(no weight given), which means even if you gave a wrong answer in just one question then, bummer, see you in B/+-.\n\n2. Prof Ghosh is extremely unorganized.\n\nLectures: Just writing down a bunch of formulas without proving/explanation. Use all the examples he made up, instead of real ones or at least from his textbooks. Contents were overtly easy. Usually spent half of the time going over last lecutre, and the last half sounded totally irrelavent to the first half because he never explained the connection between different parts of knowledge.\n\nTextbooks: Enjoy reading children's \"\"encyclopedia\"\" rather a real textbook.\n\nNo good grade-wise nor knowledge-wise.

We didn't know what to expect for each exams because he doesn't explain very well, just writes a bunch of formulas. His review sessions aren't even review session so don't bother. The homework doesn't align with his teachings sometimes and it makes it much more difficult to do - on top of that they mark off the tiniest of mistakes so you lose points easier. Ghosh doesn't like to use canvas so every assignment/ graded material was emails to us back and forth so it was very unorganized and hard to keep track of your grade.

Each week we were assigned a set of lecture videos to watch and take notes on, a practice exercise, a lab, and a HW assignment. The lecture videos and notes took less than an hour each week and the practice exercise normally took about 30-45 minutes. The lab was slightly more difficult but we were given some skeleton code to follow along with. The HW assignments were incredibly long and honestly pretty difficult. Experience in R is not a pre-req for the class but it definitely helps.

It's Web Assign with three overall submission tries meaning each try counts for the entire assignment. The HW's are insanely long to do and all pretty much word problems so if you hated those well here they are to fuck you one last time before you graduate. The biggest helpful advice I can give you is to recognize what type of question each problem is asking you and to do each HW before the Quizzes.\n\nThe Quizzes themselves are the HW so if you do them before they are due you'll have a fighting chance. A lot of people didn't pick this up until too late. Every discussion ends with a quizz and yeah you get a quizz and HW literally a day before the final. Jill has no mercy.\n\nAll in all if you can get 90% and above on the HW's and Quizzes you may just pass this class but it won't be an easy task. THE HW IS HARD. This is a heavy class to balance and if you don't put time and effort into this class you'll definitely repeat it. ",

Very detailed and organized teacher with materials as well. Second half of the content was harder though as it started to involve more involved formulas and integrals, so if you want great grade than its best to focus hard on the last half.

Homework takes an average of 2+ hours depending on your skill in Vietnamese and typing in Vietnamese. \nHer knowledge in Vietnamese has been said to be outdated and inaccurate by students who are more intact of their culture from their parents. Even those parents are confused by her teachings. She yells at students during lecture (on Zoom), and accuses all of them of being unmindful if they are unable to remember 100% of her past teachings if they took her previous classes like VNM001 and VNM 002. She expects you to be above and beyond in Vietnamese, meanwhile her English is not on par. \nShe accuses students of copying homework even though she encourages you to work together... and homework does not allow for many unique variations between ~25 students. \nShe gives you a mock test at the beginning of the quarter to make sure everyone understands how her tests work... but then applies those points to your grade, therefore dropping it if you got a low score. \nShe is biased and bullies students. She will round your grade up if she liked you that quarter, so mostly everyone tries to kiss her ass even though they all dislike her. \nShe does not allow for absences or to attend class on Zoom unless you have COVID. She does not accept any excuse unless you have medical proof to show her, which is an invasion of privacy and heartless. She is ableist. \nI managed to pass with a B+ but I honestly do not understand how she calculates your grade. She does not know how to add weights her assignments in Canvas, so what you see at the end of the quarter may not align with what it actually is... Usually it is better by a letter grade.",

Sometimes there is demonstrations of the instruments and you get to play some in discussion. 3 listening quizzes (online), final paper on a concert you attended, and final exam. Try not to procrastinate on the final paper. Ask TA's for help if needed since they will be grading the essay. Go to lecture and take good notes since you can use them for the quizzes (open note). Extra credit is also offered towards the end if you haven't been doing good on the tests. Would definitely recommend taking this course. I would take again.",

So make sure you're able to have some thoughts or your own opinions on Japanese literature for analysis. There are 3 response questions per week based on the lectures or readings, 2 multiple-choice quizzes that are super easy, and 3 papers. No midterm/finals. Overall, highly recommended for breadth course requirement or those that are interested in Japanese field if you're ready to do several analysis of the readings. ",

These quizzes were impossible to pass if you didn't do any form of studying. The final was multiple choice and worth 20% of your grade. Not too difficult and not too easy, but just like the quizzes, impossible to pass if you didn't do any studying.\nThe class overall, wasn't too difficult, but a lot of the concepts felt \"foreign\" and even when I did get the right answer in a quiz, I never felt confident when I was writing the answer. Javier is a good professor, and know this because this wasn't my first time having him as a professor, but I feel like this course wasn't his strong suit, and at times he couldn't really explain some of the concepts to the best of his ability.

She allowed us to use our notes during the midterm and final. Overall the homeworks weren't that difficult, just tedious sometimes. Labs can be rough in the beginning, but once you get used to the program you have to use, the labs should only give you trouble with writing the programs in verilog. That being said always ask for help when you don't know how to do something in verilog. My TA and lab mates were a great help and made the labs super short(30-45 mins) towards the end of the quarter. I also had to do a final project with a partner during the last 2 weeks, which wasn't that bad. You have 3 projects to chose from. ",

But they can be time consuming if you don't know how to debug. I can't say how the final project is during the regular quarters, but summer projects are pretty easy.

Don't use Google for these essays though, get the content straight from the reading and the powerpoints because thats what they look for. Personally I never really showed up to lecture or did the readings and got by really easily with an A just using my resources during the tests since you're allowed to use any material. If you need the extra points Professor Tofigh offers a grade bump with iEval (i think it was 10% extra on the 3rd mc test).",

If you did not show up to the lecture in person, just pull up PollEv on your device and wait for the questions to pop up. The PollEv questions were also what made up a majority of the midterm questions, so knowing the right answers to the questions was important. The essay questions/exams were not difficult nor lengthy, just make sure to address ALL subquestions when writing the essay, and do not go over the word limit. The TAs would be the ones grading the essays, so pray you get a nice TA. Overall, though this class gives you no HW, it was a lot of busy work during exams season, and an easy A.",

The class has clicker/attendance which are worth 10% of your grade so be warned. The most important thing in this class is understanding KEY WORDS / BUZZ WORDS. In his essay/midterm instructions or even when he reiterates several times in lecture, he will tell you to follow a certain essay format (introduction, 1-2 paragraphs, conclusion, etc) but do not listen to him. The key is memorizing KEY WORDS to do well on the essays/midterm/final. For example, if a prompt asks about energy changes in the industrial revolution, you only need to say \"energy changed from wood, wind, water to iron, coal, steam\" and that's basically 20% of your grade awarded to you.

Unlike most other professors, those of us who had to get a job/extra jobs during school because of the pandemic weren't accommodated in terms of participation we had to miss (and it was 25% of final grade). He was also really inconsiderate about money, for example he said that a $50 2nd textbook cost couldn't be waived but it's \"just a fraction of your tuition anyway\" (he also mentioned during this announcement that people told him they were struggling to afford food/rent and he basically responded with \"That sucks but I can't do anything about it,\" it was unbelievable).

I think most people in my class can agree that she does a poor job at teaching the class. She speeds through the powerpoint, and changes homework questions the night before assigning them ( from last years hw questions ), leaving some problems very difficult to solve since she hasn't worked out the answers yet. For one homework assignment she even had to change a homework question 3 times because she didn't check the difficult of it beforehand. A lot of the hw questions are very vague and require meeting with a TA to understand how to solve. In terms of quizzes, she give a quiz 'syllabus' and 'sample' quizzes for each quiz, which is nice, but the material on the actual quizzes were very different than the sample ones. She actually gives quite a bit of extra credit for the quizzes though, so keep that in mind. Usually in class, she'll give you a timed ~5min problem than you can choose to answer for extra credit ( 1-2 points ) that gets added to the next quiz. At the end of the quarter she also give an extra credit quiz worth ~9 quiz points, if you can prove a few of the really challenging proofs she goes over through the course. In total, the amount of extra credit you could potentially get was close to 15 points which is 50% of a quiz grade ( out of 30 points normally ). The final was on the difficult side, with the average around 60% but she slightly curves it, so that the average is around 65/70%. Overall, prepare to spend a lot of time outside of the class on this course.   ",

Unfortunately, I was part of the quarter that had the online final, so all I have to say about that is it was overkill - part 1 had too many questions, there was too little time, and part 2 was too difficult to even attempt. Best of luck",

The first quiz is basically a CS11 review and is ROUGH for everyone, as she basically expects you study for it by yourself. The only real concept that we use a lot from CS11 is induction and the score for this quiz can get replaced later. \nMake sure to start the homeworks as early as you can, USE HER OFFICE HOURS as they honestly helped me a ton. Do the problems on the quiz syllabuses and the practice quizzes, as they definitely help out. Elena is an alright lecturer, but be sure to pay attention as a lot of the material builds off each other. \nOur final was online cause of COVID-19, open note and on zoom, but pretty concept based. The average of our quiz scores was used to form 1 half off the final grade, pretty sick imo. \n\nDefinitely can't slouch in this class.",

For the summer, Elena gave out quizzes, worth 45% total. Quizzes were open note (no looking at slides). Final was closed-book and completely on graphs. Elena often gives us 5-10 to upload exam material to iLearn - hard if you\u2019re uploading pictures.\n\nFinal grade was composed of grade on final exam and grade on quizzes. I highly recommend doing well on quizzes (80% or higher, if possible). Elena allowed us to replace bad scores on the quizzes with practice problems (similar to those we got wrong). After the final, Elena required us to state whether we cheated or not (submit pdf on Gradescope).Elena has a very strong, somewhat annoying, emphasis on cheating - to the point where it's very annoying.\n\nElena also almost always never posts the submission links for homework until you tell her to. For example, if homework is due Wednesday 11:59 pm and you don\u2019t see the submission link at Tuesday 8 pm, email her to tell her to release the submission. \n\n",

Please take it with anyone but her. she won't even answer ur questions you ask her, she'll just say its easy and give a convoluted explanation that makes no sense. so you have to self learn and end up losing points on the hw because its not the \"right\" answer. For the winter 2021 final it was divided into two parts and part 2 could either cover all the material from the course (minus graphs which she just sped through and didn't cover properly at all) or it could be replaced with your quiz average. Part 1 is all graph theory and for the final she made it so damn difficult (10 questions mostly proofs and stuff we had never seen before). most students ended leaving multiple blank because she never taught us how to do these problems. she's admitted before she could never deal with timed quizzes and hard finals if she were in our shoes so idk why she structures it like this.",

Every test is a time scramble and time is probably one of the largest factors here. The homeworks are required to be written in LATEX which you have to learn at the beginning but is not too bad once you get the hang of it, just time consuming. However do be warned, the grading was extremely non transparent. A grade shift curve was applied at the end but however was not released so students did not know how much their grades got shifted if at all and emails to the professor asking about the general curve were not answered. Basically, watch your time during quizzes tests and know proofs. This class has many proofs in the lectures and in the final. There were a total of 4 quizzes total and a 2 part final, the 2nd part of the final being optional (If you didn't take, the average of your quizzes were the score used for the second part of the final). The averages for the quizzes in our class were 74.4%, 71.3%, 80%, and 71.5% and the finals were 61.73%(part 1) and 67.92% (part 2) and the homework average across 5 assignments were 88.29%.  (After regrades, the averages are probably slightly higher) Asking many students about their grades after the curved, I could be totally off but I would give an estimated guess of about a 3-6% curve to your final grade.",

No matter if you choose Chrobak or Elena (who is the head professor), you will have a hard time. \nLectures are heavily dense with explanations on the mathematical proofs behind why a certain theorem exists, which aren't utilized for the homework or exams at all, at least for this quarter. It is unironically a better experience watching Khan Academy or Numberphile on YouTube than attending lecture. ACR tutoring for this class filled up extremely fast too, so good luck getting any outside tutoring. The final only focused on graphs and was worth 30% of the grade.\nFinal for BOTH sections were moved to the earlier scheduled final, which opens up the risk for time conflicts. The final was also only 2 hours instead of 3 hours. Grades released within TWO days of taking the final, which created grading errors. Average on the final across both sections was a 57%. However, because the maximum was a 93.8%, that was the curve that was used, so it didn't impact much. \nSurvey was taken for this class. 50% were expecting to fail the final, 48% hated the decision to move the final earlier, 81% felt that 2 hours wasn't enough, 67% felt sample materials weren't sufficient enough to study for the final, 67% said the final was harder than expected, and 90% were in favor of a steeper curve.\nFuture classes that require this class as a prerequisite only require a D-, keep that in mind before dropping early -- it will still screw with your GPA though",

For the quizzes, the mock quizzes she gave a few days before the quiz were more helpful than the google drive ones. She also gave 40 mins a quiz vs 30 mins when I took it the first time with chrobak so that definitely helped me a lot. I would spend around 3 days studying for the quizzes, 1 day to work through google drive samples, 1 day to time myself on the mock quiz, and another to go through lecture problems. This is really necessary as the final was all on graphs and since its worth 35% it can bring your grade down harshly.

His midterm and final pretty much cover everything youd done in the hw and quizzes. WATCH OUT FOR THE QUIZZES the biggest grade killer imo, you get like no time to do them so if you cant snap out a question immediately its pretty much over for that question killed by grade and got me a D+ even with a cruve.
