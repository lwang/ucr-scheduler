There is assigned readings but not really any hw besides readings and essays, I only remember having to write like a paragraph and turn it in online. She links back readings and videos we watch in class to lectures, expects a mention or 2 in your essays, and many questions on the midterm and final are based on them. In short, doing the readings, they're pretty important. Her TAs can be strict or lenient, pray on that, as they grade your 3 essays. McMullin is very much lenient herself, she gave us an extra credit opportunity for 30 free points on our 200 point midterm and even gave us the final's essay questions as take home. \n\nTLDR: Easy class, IF you do the readings. DO READINGS. ",

The quizzes are very straightforward and short, the exams are exactly what he describes them to be. My TA Johanna Najera was also super nice and she is very knowledgable on the topics that we learn. She also worked with the professor on various excavations that he went to. Overall a pretty easy and engaging class, just make sure you show up to every lecture because he asks mini quiz questions throughout every lecture. ",

When you register, it shows the class and studio time. It's one after the other, so you're there for nearly 3 hours. Don't get discouraged by the time, it's necessary to have a long class for art because of the activities you're doing and sometimes there will be critiques - where everyone goes around to talk about what they liked about the drawing and what could be improved/done differently. Attendance is mandatory, if you miss one class you can miss out on a lot if it was on a critique day. Your homework is 3 large drawings each week, and she gives you a theme for the drawings, it's all still life for the most part. This class does require you to buy art supplies.",

Art is a subjective course so you can pretty much do whatever you want in this class (as long as it pertains to the theme). Every week there's a new theme (figure, landscape, still life, etc.) and you just need to paint things based on that theme. The materials can get really pricey but Gerald was pretty lenient with whatever material you use. The online class was set up with you logging on and following Gerald's painting examples but there were also times where you explain your painting process and thoughts when you showcase and review your pieces in class. If you want an easy course without minding spending somewhere between $50-$100+ on materials then go for this class. ",

Used \u201cAssist.org\u201d to help which city college class can transfer to ucr engl 1a. In the end, don\u2019t waste your energy this class because bswt 003 is joke and rigged asf. I wouldn\u2019t recommend it if ppl got place this class after taking AWPE, either place to bswt 001, 002 and 003. It just waste of energy and time investment. ",

To study for midterms, I would write out notes based off of the learning objectives. Then I would make Anki cards using my notes and the exact wording that was used on the learning objectives.

I actually really enjoyed it, most of my friends didn't attend lecture if it was their first class and still got A's (I got an A-). One thing to watch out for is he will try to trick you on the midterms (all multiple choice): you will read the question, immediately know the answer, and when you get the midterm back realize you read it wrong! Be sure to read each midterm question carefully, and if you are choosing \"the obvious answer\" read the question and think of the concept carefully. Beyond that, he is hilarious, the videos are hilarious, but the lecture/OH is a bit boring (he repeats himself... a lot). Still, most I know really struggle with Bio 5A, Maduro knows this and tries to give us as much help as possible without throwing A's at us. He'll give you every exam he's ever written (some going back to 2006 I think?), do them all! Oh, and a pro-tip I wish I discovered sooner: the video have a \"view captions\" tab, and most of the quiz questions (which halt the video) are discussed right after in the script, so you can look there \"to confirm your answer\".",

He does recorded lectures with set of notes and holds live office hours. The videos can be long and kind of boring because of his monotone voice. I recommend you read the notes before you start the videos, that way you learn and retain more during the videos. There are 2 noncumulative midterms, 3 noncumulative quizzes, and 1 cumulative final. Please take this class seriously and study at least one week before each exam or quiz. Dr. Kelly did a great job of providing \"What you need to know\" slides at the end of each lecture so that you can really pinpoint what to study. There is NO CURVE and NO EC. I also recommend doing well on the very first midterm as that will set the stage and also get 100% on your lab portion as that is 25% of your final grade and can really give you that boost.

This quarter (Fall 2019) I thought the lab final was cake, as it was just all the worksheets and the practice exam that were on the exam, but do study if you want high grade.

The midterm and exam weren't too difficult. Honestly, if you just find random quizlets with accounting questions and use those to study, chances are that you'll see similar questions on his exams. The prof doesn't really teach - he just shows you how to do textbook problems without explaining anything. He assigned us weekly quizzes, but I didn't find them that useful. They only showed us what types of questions he was going to give us on the exams. He also didn't give us a practice midterm or final which I thought was inconsiderate, considering we were online and he wasn't that good of a professor. The TAs were also barely useful. They would just upload videos explaining the answers to quizzes, but those explanations weren't that good in my opinion. I think that this class was manageable, but not a good experience. ",

Equations are WAY easier than in most statistics classes and you are allowed to make a \"cheat sheet\" for exams so you don't really have to memorize any.

At first, it was annoying that he sends out about 5 emails reminding you to do the web assignment before the first lecture (basically a ~15 minute survey for every class that relates to the lesson - he collects the students' stats to present in class). The professor is pretty lenient with the web assignments being submitted a little bit late, but that's not the case for the write ups. In the class besides the web assignments, there are 5 write-ups (with assigned readings ranging from like 5 to 15 pages, a big one being 30ish) in total that you need to do out of 8 offered in 10 weeks. The first two write ups (counted as 1) is with a randomly assigned group and was 600 words each. The rest, you are free to chose as long as you have done 5. There's no midterm and only a final - the final you have the option to go solo or choose a partner/have the professor choose one for you. The final is about a case study with 6 questions and all he tells you is that you have to use class concepts for it. You have 5 days to complete it and it had a word limit of 2000. The professor is great, he makes every topic interesting and has a lot of opportunities for extra credit throughout the quarter. Should basically be a pretty easy A class as long as you make the effort to do the web assignments and write ups. They're due every Thursday but if you turn it in the Sunday before, you get an extra credit point added to your score. I'd really recommend this class as an elective! My concentration is IS and this was definitely one of the easier classes I've taken and it was genuinely a good class. ",

The class is mainly asynchronous with 2 live sessions - one on the first day and another around week 3. One midterm and one final (noncumulative) with most questions from the textbook and a few made by him based on the homework. There are about 4 homework assignments spread out evenly, so make sure to start a little earlier. He has extended one homework before due to some students being unable to install Microsoft Office software properly, but be reasonable and don't start the day before it's due and ask for an extension lol. Two out of four were using Microsoft Access. The last homework is always a small research paper where you have to explain a concept (for this class it was the difference between relational databases and NoSQL). Pretty easy class if you just do the work.",

Overall CHEM001B isn't bad but it's a little more difficult than CHEM001A. I heard from my upperclassman friends that it's the hardest in the CHEM001 series, but we'll see. Just review the end of chapter problems, do the practice midterm, review the clicker questions, and the homework before the midterms/final and you'll be set!

Attending the Zoom lecture was recommended and he occasionally tossed in some clicker questions to reward those who actively attended. Chem 1B builds off of the information you learned in Chem 1A so it's good to brush up on some of those topics. Like others are saying, this class is a lot of equations and plugging and chugging. The word problems are tricky too. Each chapter was a new concept for me, so it took me a while (and a lot of Khan Academy...) to fully understand the concepts and how the equations worked. Reading the textbook is extremely helpful and he bases most of his exam questions off of what he teaches on the slides. Zhao presents his information pretty thoroughly and takes the time to help students who are stuck. This class moves fairly quickly, so understanding all of the concepts is vital to earning a good grade. Unfortunately, the exams are all closed book and proctored. Clicker questions (20%), discussion points (10%), and homework (20%) make up 50% of the grade (as well as potential bonus points). For us, the homework had unlimited tries and there was no penalty for wrong answers. There are 2 midterms (10% each) and a final (30%). The exams aren't curved (I think), but the final class grade is based on a curve. Overall, I enjoyed this class a lot and I recommend taking it with Zhao!",

Luckily, she's not a cruel professor and curved the class so that the average student got a B. For reference, class averages for the midterms and final were around D-F range. I got above average twice(about 1-3 points above) and below average once(1 point below), and I got a B+ in the class. Tang's class is really a tossup",

If you read/ skim the book (for the conceptual questions) and do calculations similar to the ones on the homework, you can get good scores on midterms. Final he repeated questions from midterms so do go to office hours and TA office hours to see your exam and review the ones missed. 1C material isn't hard but the chapter on acid and base and its equilibria was I thought the hardest.

Highly recommend not taking with Jiang if you don't already have experience with gen chem (ex: taking a year of chem in high school/ap chem) because he can tend to be very conceptual instead of mathematical (and the midterms are mathematical). The poll/clicker questions can be pretty difficult because he doesn't really teach them beforehand so you're kind of learning as you go. The homework can also be frustrating because in the later chapters he doesn't do a lot of practice problems that are similar to what's on the homework. The midterms are pretty ok as long as you review the quizzes, poll/clicker questions, and homework. Practice midterm was helpful too because he goes over it in class.

He is a laid back professor and does a good job at teaching the material. He applies it to the real world as well. Homework is assigned through smartwork and is due at the end of the quarter before the final. He also assigned practice quizzes which are really important because they are exactly like the midterms and final. There are 2 midterms and 1 final. Your better score is weighted heavier so that you get a better grade and exams are not proctored. He also offers 100 EC for good questions. Each question is worth 1 extra point.

I ended up getting close to an A, but I spent a LOT of time outside of class. The material itself is not difficult, but the midterms can be difficult. Also, he stopped posting his lectures online, so attending lecture is a must. Overall, the class is not super difficult but it for sure is not an easy A, especially if you aren't a compsci major. ",

He does all of his assignments via Zybooks. Tip for the class, plan out your schedule because every week, there's 5 activities that you have to complete every week (some of them might be really short, some of them might take a long time).

CS010 is very easy, but CS012 really picks up the pace.\n\nAlso if you take it with Miller, his exams have \"themes\", where the MC part of the exam will completely revolve around 1 concept. He'll usually give hints to what it is during class. He'll talk about some concept for 30 seconds and will say \"ya this might be on your midterm\" and then never talk about it again. When I took it with him, the theme of our midterm was compiler flags. It's basically his way of figuring out whether you went to class or not. Also, its his way of ensuring that if you only study the mock midterm he posts like the night before, you will fail, because he changes the themes every couple of quarters. The night before my midterm, he posted a mock midterm that completely revolved around argc and argv[], and because I studied just that, I completely bombed the midterm the next day, which like I said before, mostly revolved around compiler flags.  \n\nIf you take anything from this, just do your assignments on time, go to class, and take note on anything that he says \"might be on the exam\" and you can basically predict what questions will end up on the exam.

I took this class Winter 2020 with Jeffrey McDaniel. He's an extremely good lecturer with lots of knowledge of the subject of C++, although I do wish he would smile more (he kinda has that mean, scary face, but really isn't all that scary). CS012 is filled with content, and you have to be on your toes and learn quickly. If you find yourself falling behind then make sure to quickly get help via office hours. Both professors and TAs have office hours, and there is SI sessions as well. This course is not too bad up until the midterm, but the stuff after is very hard. Pointers, Linked Lists, and Recursion are all difficult topics, which difficult programming assignments. I found myself having to collaborate with people to get through the assignments, even though you are not allowed to collaborate. Please make sure you do not use GitHub code on your assignments, that's how many people got caught. Instead, get help from friends, TAs, and professors, they will often lead you in the right path and that way you make sure that you are learning the material. Definitely review pointers and linked lists before going to CS014.",

Conceptual understanding wasn't a problem, as LePendu really makes sure people nail that portion of the subject. It's not too difficult of a class but taking it online because of COVID-19 did add some learning struggles. The midterm was easy but the final was HARD. I do wish that some of the programming labs that were smaller in size would be 1-person labs as working on them with a group meant you didn't do much coding on your own. More coding practice would've been better as all technical interviews pull from the knowledge you learn in CS014.

Do well on quizzes and study for the final cuz it\u2019s a huge chunk of the grade (50%)",

He was a great prof overall, but a lot of the shorthand notation he used nobody was fully familiar with and he acted like it was common knowledge when he'd write those hieroglyphics on the board lol. I crammed the exams bc i had other difficult classes to cater to, but I'd like to say i did fine. Just make sure you do the practice problems and try to not let this class sit on the backburner like i did. study frequently, bc a lot of this class is very new in terms of notation. its like learning another language kinda. a bunch of proofs too. however, once you get that down its pretty straightforward",

Final was much tougher. (remember, you need 70% or higher to pass the class). I believe the uncurved average was something like 55%. Lucky for us, he bell curved it to increase the average to 66.6%. I would have failed the class, but luckily ended up with a 72% on the final after the curve. Programming assignments aren't too hard. Labs are killer.

However, if you asked him during office hours the attention he gives you individually really helps you understand. The grading is pretty strict, but he's been known to give exceptions to some people (for example, I was allowed to turn in HW late, I'm a girl so idk if that has anything to do with it or my friend who's black also was caught cheating but was allowed to re-submit his assignment and passed the course). DON'T CHEAT! My friends got caught. He puts specific things in the template to catch the cheating. Also the TA Robert Colvin was the most helpful, but you have to walk through this logic in your head with him or classmates, or you'll never be able to catch up from falling off the boat at the early part of the term. The HW was pretty easy and even if you have the wrong answer, as long as you gave a credible, honest working to your solution, they'll assume you did it right and give you full marks. There are 5 projects and are pretty annoying because they go through an auto-grader in gradescope, so start early. Correspondance in the course goes through piazza, which is a bit annoying. The quizzes are pretty hard, but open book/resources. The final for our term (Fall 2019) was unlike anyone's final and REALLY bad. The midterm is hard but if you overkill yourself studying it's really not that bad. He gives plenty of resources to help. 70% of the midterm/final is multiple choice anyway.",

It's a huge learning curve from writing small programs to designing and coding an entire Linux Shell throughout the course. The design patterns may seem easy to understand in the slides, but when asked to apply them, will be difficult. Do yourself a favor and ASK FOR HELP. For the first couple of weeks I went to the professor's office hours almost every chance I got. \n\nI would ask the professor questions that I would consider to be base knowledge for many students, and Professor Crites was more than helpful in answering my questions and informing me on what I should catch up on in terms of prereq knowledge. Super approachable professor who will go out of his way to help you. The tests aren't all too bad if you review the slides and understand the gist of the design patterns. \n\nThe assignments and labs are what you should focus on if you want to pass the class. If you do well on them you can pass the class on the basis of labs and assignments alone. The main project that you will be working on throughout the course does not really require any specific design pattern, so it's up to you to decide how you will design it. My advice for the assignment is think of the long term and make sure that your code is flexible and able to add features relatively easily. Otherwise you will run into the issue that I and many students have in this class where you will find yourself rewriting your code almost every assignment in order to meet spec and make things work. You will not be allowed to switch partners for assignments (at least I don't think) so choose your partner wisely. \n\nLabs aren't too bad, except the instructions for the labs can seem kind of vague at times and most of the time will be spent figuring out what the hell you're actually supposed to do or what the output is supposed to be. But once you understand the instructions it's not too bad. \n\nDO NOT, wait until the day or even a few days before your assignment is due to start your code. I've tried it, don't bring that stress and anxiety upon yourself like I did. You will lose your mind. You will question your major. Don't give up, always ask for help and everything will be okay. ",

Labs are chill if you have a good partner, but beware of the hammer server, it's such a pain to use.\n\nThe midterm was so bad he had to curve. The final on the other hand was MUCH easier, split up into two days so the final lecture was the multiple choice portion and the scheduled final day was the conceptual/written portion. Make sure you know how to draw UML diagrams properly because they will show up on both midterm and final.\n\nThe assignments are basically the final project but split up into 4 assignments, so each assignment builds from the previous one. You have to build a C++ shell, and he does not teach any of this during lecture so read up on it early before he starts posting assignments. If you screw up an assignment, you have to go back and fix it before you move onto the next one. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A GOOD PARTNER.

The actual material is fine, because you get taught the subject abstractly before you apply it in lab which is very nice. The labs are essential to passing the exams. The project is a bit difficult because of the documentation that has to be read and the partner you have. My partner did some work later on in the quarter, but the beginning was all me. So that made it difficult for my partner to understand all my code. I eventually finished it all, and it was fun.",

Which was very vague and not helpful in applying our skills. Everyone else seems to say that he was helpful, but despite going to office hours he was very curt/unhelpful to me. I'm not an idiot and could hold my own in conversations with him, but I received the most help from my peers or those at the transfer center, who helped me walk out the logic of the unix terminal without giving away the answers. The grader for the course, Luis Garcia, was one I had to constantly fight with because he graded things super late. He graded our major class assignments during Week 11. Crites also added \"ethics assignments\" that I think as a minority are pretty insensitive. One was \"define your personal definition of hate speech\", wtf? I'm all for adding representation to social issues and the consideration with technology is a good idea, but this was a horrible execution. He's gone now so idk if this is relevant anymore.",

I think most people in my class can agree that she does a poor job at teaching the class. She speeds through the powerpoint, and changes homework questions the night before assigning them ( from last years hw questions ), leaving some problems very difficult to solve since she hasn't worked out the answers yet. For one homework assignment she even had to change a homework question 3 times because she didn't check the difficult of it beforehand. A lot of the hw questions are very vague and require meeting with a TA to understand how to solve. In terms of quizzes, she give a quiz 'syllabus' and 'sample' quizzes for each quiz, which is nice, but the material on the actual quizzes were very different than the sample ones. She actually gives quite a bit of extra credit for the quizzes though, so keep that in mind. Usually in class, she'll give you a timed ~5min problem than you can choose to answer for extra credit ( 1-2 points ) that gets added to the next quiz. At the end of the quarter she also give an extra credit quiz worth ~9 quiz points, if you can prove a few of the really challenging proofs she goes over through the course. In total, the amount of extra credit you could potentially get was close to 15 points which is 50% of a quiz grade ( out of 30 points normally ). The final was on the difficult side, with the average around 60% but she slightly curves it, so that the average is around 65/70%. Overall, prepare to spend a lot of time outside of the class on this course.   ",

Elena often gives us 5-10 to upload exam material to iLearn - hard if you\u2019re uploading pictures.\n\nFinal grade was composed of grade on final exam and grade on quizzes. I highly recommend doing well on quizzes (80% or higher, if possible). Elena allowed us to replace bad scores on the quizzes with practice problems (similar to those we got wrong). After the final, Elena required us to state whether we cheated or not (submit pdf on Gradescope).Elena has a very strong, somewhat annoying, emphasis on cheating - to the point where it's very annoying.\n\nElena also almost always never posts the submission links for homework until you tell her to. For example, if homework is due Wednesday 11:59 pm and you don\u2019t see the submission link at Tuesday 8 pm, email her to tell her to release the submission. \n\n",

Office hours is worth it though. \n\nFinal was absolutely killer, MUCH harder than any of the practice exams they gave us. The CS111 discord server had a poll and 34/34 voted that it was hard as fuck, not even a single troll vote saying that it was easy. ",

However, the grading distribution is what hurts students. Also, the final was split into 2 parts. First part was mandatory and only tests on graphs, but the second part is optional. If you don't take the part 2, it's your quiz average. If you do, it'll test you on the rest of the course material, but whatever you get (even if it's lower than the quiz average) is your grade on this portion. Each portion is 20% of your final grade. 4 quizzes = 40%, and 5 hw = 20%.",

Every test is a time scramble and time is probably one of the largest factors here. The homeworks are required to be written in LATEX which you have to learn at the beginning but is not too bad once you get the hang of it, just time consuming. However do be warned, the grading was extremely non transparent. A grade shift curve was applied at the end but however was not released so students did not know how much their grades got shifted if at all and emails to the professor asking about the general curve were not answered. Basically, watch your time during quizzes tests and know proofs. This class has many proofs in the lectures and in the final. There were a total of 4 quizzes total and a 2 part final, the 2nd part of the final being optional (If you didn't take, the average of your quizzes were the score used for the second part of the final). The averages for the quizzes in our class were 74.4%, 71.3%, 80%, and 71.5% and the finals were 61.73%(part 1) and 67.92% (part 2) and the homework average across 5 assignments were 88.29%.  (After regrades, the averages are probably slightly higher) Asking many students about their grades after the curved, I could be totally off but I would give an estimated guess of about a 3-6% curve to your final grade.",

No matter if you choose Chrobak or Elena (who is the head professor), you will have a hard time. \nLectures are heavily dense with explanations on the mathematical proofs behind why a certain theorem exists, which aren't utilized for the homework or exams at all, at least for this quarter. It is unironically a better experience watching Khan Academy or Numberphile on YouTube than attending lecture. ACR tutoring for this class filled up extremely fast too, so good luck getting any outside tutoring. The final only focused on graphs and was worth 30% of the grade.\nFinal for BOTH sections were moved to the earlier scheduled final, which opens up the risk for time conflicts. The final was also only 2 hours instead of 3 hours. Grades released within TWO days of taking the final, which created grading errors. Average on the final across both sections was a 57%. However, because the maximum was a 93.8%, that was the curve that was used, so it didn't impact much. \nSurvey was taken for this class. 50% were expecting to fail the final, 48% hated the decision to move the final earlier, 81% felt that 2 hours wasn't enough, 67% felt sample materials weren't sufficient enough to study for the final, 67% said the final was harder than expected, and 90% were in favor of a steeper curve.\nFuture classes that require this class as a prerequisite only require a D-, keep that in mind before dropping early -- it will still screw with your GPA though",

It can be difficult for CS/EE majors at first, but if you're a Computer Engineer, you'll feel right at home. I recommend taking this after CS100 to get used to Github. This class is VERY VERY VERY lab-focused. Labs were 45% of the total grade, and you have 1-2 each week. No final, but there weekly quizzes that aren't worth stressing over. Most of the labs take at least 3 hours minimum, and the average is 4ish hours. If you have a good professor (like Vahid), you'll love Embedded Systems.",

I think he is a good teacher, it's just this is a difficult class. A friend took this class before, dropped out halfway through because he failed his midterm. He retook it with me, and said he prefers Stefano to his old teacher, as he explains clearly and uses lecture notes/slides to his advantage. Do not underestimate this class though. The average on both midterms was a 62%. Stefano does curve, he drops lowest scoring question on both the midterms and the final. The midterms were 4 questions/25 points each, the final was 10 questions/10 points each. The class itself is curved, the A range is 100-80%, B is 70-79.9%, C is 60-69.9%.. etc. So you are given that 10% grace. This is the first 'hard' cs class usually taken by undergraduates, at least for me, and it's a tough one. Do not underestimate it.",

In the beginning, you're dealing with Master Theorem, which isn't too hard once you study it and understand it completely. But, once you start touching upon Greedy Algorithms and Dynamic Programming is when the class really starts to feel really difficult. You must study the material as soon as you can; otherwise, you'll feel really left behind, and it will result in you not knowing what the hell you're writing about on your quizzes and/or homework assignments. After Greedy and DP, you deal with shortest path algorithms, which weren't super difficult, but still left an impact on you. Overall, CS141 is probably one of the hardest upper-division CS courses you'll ever take. It's not easy to get an A in this class; you'll be happy with a C, and you'll know exactly why.",

Homeworks are hard, I had to cave in and get a chegg subscription to answer some problems because getting as many points as possibly is crucial in this course. Homeworks are similar to CS111 in the sense that it may ask you to apply a concept to answer a problem that doesn't have examples available to study from. That in mind, pay attention to homework and study the solutions because some showed up on the exam with some changes. Exam questions are hard, but easier than the homework IMO. Didn't mean I did good though cause I couldn't do the majority of hw problems without online help. You'll need to know the pseudocode for the algorithms in the slides because a couple will show up on the exam, in the sense that you need to write down the exact pseudocode or will have to use it as a part of your answer. There might be one or two really easy questions, but they'll be easy if you remember what its asking for like recurrence relations/master theorem/drawing huffman tree. Lectures are useful especially for greedy and dynamic programming, please don't skip for those or the slides won't make any sense. Plenty of people that skipped had issues with these. Only lectures I would recommend skipping are the first one(just talks about big O) and the last couple ones since what you need to know are pseudocodes for the graph algorithms.\n\nTLDR: Its a hard class. Exams and homework are hard. Exams get curved. Lectures are great, helps with understanding the info the majority of the time. Still, even if its a terrible experience you'll learn quite a lot concepts for interview questions. Also grading scale is 10% lowered. I.e A = 80-100%, B = 70-80%...D=50-60% so on and so forth. Haven't gotten my grade yet so I don't know if there is more curving.",

This class is significantly more difficult than cs111; to pass this class you will need to have a solid study schedule. I watched every lecture 3 times since it was an online class. The real challenge of this class is that every problem is nothing like any problem you have ever seen; every question is completely unique and you must rely on basic principles to figure out an optimal solution. Midterms that were 20% of your grade often only had 2 problems, each question being 10% of your grade. So you MUST get them correct. The curve was probably around 30% at the end I would bet.",

You can choose to complete Phase 3 in C++ or C, but you need to take extra steps to implement in C++. There's some good info about that on stackoverflow and the bison documentation. You will get at least 70/100 points on Phase 3 if you implement enough stuff, so even if it doesn't pass the test cases, you should be fine if the implementation makes sense. It also has to compile on the bolt server without errors or else you will get a 0; they won't fix your makefile for you.

He gave us all the topics before the tests as well some previous exam questions that ended up on the tests. Homework questions also appeared on the tests. The average for the midterm was a around high 70 percent I think.  Though, maybe this'll change so watch out. Also, and I'm not sure if the other people that reviewed the class had the same lab manual as us, the labs were fairly straightforward. The manuals tell you all the code changes you need to do in the sense that it tells you what functions to change and in what file. Though it can be hard to actually implement the changes you need to do. \nTLDR: Exams and homework fairly decent in terms of difficultly. Labs are the hardest part, but always ask for help from others or TA when you're stuck. If you want to get an in depth knowledge of OS then read the book, its actually a simple and interesting read IMO.",

He literally takes questions straight from the homeworks and previous exams to make each new one. Why is that bad you might ask? Well he curves overall grades by PERCENTILE. To illustrate my point, the class average was a 90% in the class. A 90%. However, because its by percentile, even if your raw grade was a 90+%, you will get curved DOWN unless you did better than 90+% of the class. It's a lazy grading scheme that allows him to put zero effort in his exams and still not have many A's in the class. I would not recommend taking ANY class with him. ",

                "comment": "When you read the title of the class you probably think \"Sweet Machine Learning, this is going to be awesome\" but it's a trap! TBH this class should have several pre reqs that are really needed in order to succeed. You need to def have Calc3/Physics > above level math skills. You really need to take Statistics before this class. Lastly you need to at least be an intermediate Python user. You will be doing proofs and if you're proof is wrong there is no way to complete a HW assignment. You need to be familiar with Python or be confused with how to do the HW. The lectures are terrible. It's just the prof reading his slides which are 80% just unlabeled graphs. The slides provided have no context so you have to come to class to understand them but even if you do no one knows what the prof is talking about and are too afraid to ask for clarification, everyone literally admitted this during a talk in the discussion. The exams don't really test you on topics the prof taught but rather you're general knowledge of the algorithms basically he expects you to know the ins and outs of the algorithms even if he didn't directly tell you about them. If you really want to take a Machine Learning course just watch Andrew NG's youtube videos, you'll learn more, not be stressed out, and you'll actually have fun. If you still want to take the course I hope you're a math god that studies every night. ",

I took it with Christian Shelton who is probably one of the best and smartest professors in CS. He's very passionate and interesting to listen to and he teaches the material in a way that keeps you interested. But, ML is inherently a very difficult field to understand, so there's only so much he can do. There are 4 homeworks(he calls them Problem Sets), two midterms and 1 final. Homeworks count for 33%, midterms count for 33% and the final counts for the last 33% of the course grade. Homeworks are done in Python on JupyterHub where he usually gives you a little bit of skeleton code.\nDo not be like me and think that ML is some Computer Science magic that makes you an oracle who can predict the future. Because it's not CS. It's linear algebra and statistics except we program it so they call it a CS class. But conceptually, this is almost purely statistics/linear algebra.",

I'm an ex-math major, and even I found the math to be a bit hard to wrap my head around at times. In this class, you learn the theory of many classic ML algorithms, and then you are expected to implement them. Overall, I think that this course requires more time for what is covered.",

Definitely recommend taking it with a friend though, since it'll make understanding material a little easier if you have someone to talk it out with.

Oh my fucking god this one class actually just made me so sad, you really need to have a solid understanding of lin alg going into the class or you're already screwed. Taking this probably hurt my chances at grad school a bit too.\nI think the CS department should rework the prereqs for this course because it's anemic and setting some bright-eyed students up to fail. To do well, you absolutely have to be passionate about the topic and theory. Having the mindset of \"oh ML sounds cool, I should take it,\" is imho, not enough for you to succeed. You gotta know that this is what you want to do and be ready to commit your soul and final 2 brain cells to this course, I recommend taking easier breadth courses in the same quarter as this class to relieve pressure, don't double up with other major req'd courses or tech electives, you're absolutely going to regret it and be depressed and in pain while regretting it.",

You'll need to be very comfortable with Python by week 2 or you will not be able to keep up with the assignments even if you have a solid understanding of statistics and math.

This is a group project class. If you don't already plan to take this class with people you know you may already have an increased difficulty. Overall the class is basically \"make anything\" and present it at the end of the class. The lectures are basically a repeat of what you've learned from other classes like CS 100. Basically it focuses on Agile Development for a majority of the time. \n\nThe class tends to push you in the direction of make a web application but really they tell you you can make anything with any tech you want but because you have team mates they will more than likely make you pick a web application as well. The first lab is in React.js so you'll more than likely choose that to work with. \n\nFor those who don't know anything about web dev stuff make sure to get a team that does because tbh it's to late to learn a lot of this stuff. Web dev consists of HTML, CSS, JS/React, and some back end Server stuff. There is no way you'll learn all of this in this semester. You either already know some of this or you'll just be a drag to you're team mates. I suggest learning as much as you can before taking the course. Try the site Codecademy. They have HTML,CSS, and React lectures for free.\n\nI rated this class a 6 because I already knew HTML,CSS and had a very rough understanding of React. I definitely grew in terms of React knowledge but did have team mates intimidated that they didn't know what was going on.",

He uses the lecture as though it were a massive discussion. He spends very little time lecturing and prefers to hear what each and every student has to say about every little sentence that he or she found interesting in the weekly reading. 100 points total in class. 1 point per page of writing. weekly readings w weekly response essays and \"writing practices.\" Each week these two assignments become a page longer, starting at 1 page and capping at 5 pages. Additionally, every 3 weeks or so, you write a story consideration (3-5 pages) in regards to your final project (5-10 pages). 20 points come from lecture + discussion attendance. Hated lecture, enjoyed discussion. Hated reading responses, didn't mind the other assignments. Also, idk what the final is bc he cancelled it when I took it (Fall '19).",

If you end up with her, please do not take the class; you\u2019ll be taking contact improvisation, a very uncomfortable class. Example: we were told to lie down while our partners have us massages. I ended up feeling violated, seriously. Jennifer was nice, but naive at times about how uncomfortable people were. Don\u2019t tell people to lie down for massages, Jen. Not everyone wants a full body massage. Anyways, contact improvisation is a very touchy class . So, if you\u2019re the type of person who wouldn\u2019t mind giving someone a full body massage, take it. If you\u2019d feel weird and grossed out about it and wouldn\u2019t want someone you may barely know, DO NOT take it. Don\u2019t make the same mistake that I did!!!",

Lang replaces your quiz scores with your midterm if you do better and adds more weight to you final if you do better on it than your midterm. He doesn't curve though. If you put actual effort into the class, it should be an easy A. I only studied the day before each exams so I only got an A-.",

Doesn't require you to buy a physical textbook (an additional $10 if you want), but does require you to purchase a TopHat subscription (basically an online version of the clickers and it counts toward your grade). Attendance in this class is crucial to your success since everything he talks about is literally on the exam (unless you have the textbook, then you might be set for the class). All of the exams are multiple choice and are very similar to the homework problems. So do your homework problems as practice before the exam! (He gives you unlimited attempts for homework problems as long as you do them before the deadline, so you have no excuse to not get a 100% in that category for the class!) Can't use a graphing calculator in class so be sure to have a scientific calculator for the calculations. ",

The professors teaching style is hard to follow along to, and I learned mostly from the lecture slides and discussions. The most important thing about this class to succeed is to do the practice problems and understand what's going on when you do the homework. The exams are almost identical to the sample ones given.",

Her handwriting is absolutely atrocious, it is extremely difficult to read what she is writing in her recorded lectures (she has a thick accent as well).  For a week, we didn't have live lectures because her computer broke and it took ages for her new one to come in.  I stopped going to lecture because it took too much effort to read what she was writing and I was learning more through YouTube/self studying.  She made the entire class buy Pearson ($100) for homework and only assigned 4 assignments throughout the entire quarter (the last two assignments were given out at the 2nd to last week of the quarter).  Her mid-term was pretty easy, but her final literally bent everyone over (she left the country almost two weeks before the final, no live lectures during this period).   If you do not have a steady foundation in Calc, do not take her.  ",

If someone does not know how to teach themselves they will not know what is going on in this class. I got a good grade in the end because everyone complained and he curved the class so he wouldn't fail everyone. But I am a good student and this class would have ruined my record. I know this is supposed to be one of the hardest classes but I can't help but feel that if B. Lang was teaching it, it would have been easy yet hard. ",

It's kind of hard to say how difficult the class is due to the project that he gave us last minute. Cheat sheets are allowed for the two midterms and the final. The midterms are based on the homework, but he switches the questions slightly (ex: \"increase\" from homework to \"decrease\" on midterm). It's basically a class with a lot of accounting stuff. He came up with a group project the Monday before Thanksgiving break, so we had to find group members outside of class and not within our discussion. So many people sent out emails to find a group and other members, so it probably delayed a lot of people in starting it. Since it was so last minute I thought it was pretty disorganized - I'm pretty sure no one wants to finish up a project during their break. The final ended up being based on the project, so just doing your part in the project probably wouldn't have been enough to know everything. It was decided that he was going to take the 3 best grades out of 2 midterms, the project, and the final. So make sure you do well on at least 3 of those. I think it's a class worth looking at, but the best experience would be going to lecture and actually knowing all the material for the group project if he decides to do it again. He's a pretty cool and funny guy - since very few people showed up to the lecture right before Thanksgiving he gave out some extra credit. ",

He doesn't answer chat questions, only hand raising (so rip if you don't have access to a microphone). He also only exclusively tests on proofs for his midterms and finals, which is not fun at all (our class average was around 40% for the midterm).

Labs can be rough in the beginning, but once you get used to the program you have to use, the labs should only give you trouble with writing the programs in verilog. That being said always ask for help when you don't know how to do something in verilog. My TA and lab mates were a great help and made the labs super short(30-45 mins) towards the end of the quarter. I also had to do a final project with a partner during the last 2 weeks, which wasn't that bad. You have 3 projects to chose from. ",

Most of the tests were basically drawing the state machines from the given problem descriptions, so you'll be fine for the quarter if you can easily do them and keep up with the material.\n\nLabs were mostly simple and aren't too bad if you have a decent partner. But they can be time consuming if you don't know how to debug. I can't say how the final project is during the regular quarters, but summer projects are pretty easy.

The class has clicker/attendance which are worth 10% of your grade so be warned. The most important thing in this class is understanding KEY WORDS / BUZZ WORDS. In his essay/midterm instructions or even when he reiterates several times in lecture, he will tell you to follow a certain essay format (introduction, 1-2 paragraphs, conclusion, etc) but do not listen to him. The key is memorizing KEY WORDS to do well on the essays/midterm/final. For example, if a prompt asks about energy changes in the industrial revolution, you only need to say \"energy changed from wood, wind, water to iron, coal, steam\" and that's basically 20% of your grade awarded to you. You do not need to be exceptionally formal; this is not an English class.",

The subject material in this class is sub-par.\nWhat really makes this class either suck hard or easy-mode are the graders; you can have all the keywords needed for a prompt, and end up with a D on your paper all because you forgot one keyword that wasn't even part of what the prompt was asking you for. If you're looking for an upper-division DEPTH course, don't take this class. It's a trap.",

You can tell both of them are passionate about their topics and like to share their lives with the class. They take turns alternating lectures and present material relevant to life. The first half is pretty much introducing the concepts and exercises, the second half of the class is producing a technical spec to standards. Extra credit is given, both before the midterm and after the midterm. I believe in our quarter 300 extra points could be earned by doing all the extra credit. If you do everything and put in a decent amount of effort, this class shouldn't be too bad. The workshops were often only 30 minutes or less. Time consuming, but difficulty wise not too bad.",

Essays are a big part of the class, don't forget to complete them. Turning in work late frequently, stagnates your grade. ",

I had an extremely hard time doing well on the essays in the beginning and my lowest essay score was an 80%, so she grades PRETTY HARSHLY. However, this does not mean you cannot pass. Her final though, YOU NEED TO HAVE TIME MANAGEMENT FOR...she gives you the fourth essay and the final  three weeks before they are due two days in a row. The finals consists of a 1500 word essay and two 500 word essays which have to do with the in class reading \"The Glass Castle\". Let me tell you...read the book the whole way through, or you WILL NOT pass this final. Basically, she assigns the fourth essay and 3 finals essays to complete in less than three weeks with no exceptions. ALSO...USE HER OFFICE HOURS...you get to read your drafts to her and she will give grammatical and content suggestions to improve your essays and also gives suggestions as to how you can use remaining days to refocus or bulk up what you are writing.",

He's very very meticulous with how he wants his assignments done and it was fairly overwhelming for a majority of the class for at least the first half of the quarter. He has a strange personality, but you can tell he's extremely passionate about his students and his career, often staying hours after his office hours to individually help his students. Three take home essays (with a crazy amount of prep time for each), one in-class essay, essay final, a few homework assignments that are basically just research and prep for your essays, and some group quizzes. You are allowed to skip the final IF you are doing well in the class (I think A's in essay 1+2) and you get at least an A- for the in-class essay. He sometimes gives opportunities to redo an essay (for a slight penalty) if you did particularly poorly or missed some key criteria required for said essay. The essays are graded pretty harshly and he is a stickler on sentence structure and grammar, but going to office hours and asking for his advice on your essay is the best way to get a good grade. Not a lot of reading other than some pages from the textbook occasionally and one pretty good book. He does make you watch some movies in the last half of the quarter, but you can do that on your own time and it's one movie a week basically. Most of his class revolves around teaching students the basics of writing and how to use the library/other sources properly. Throughout the quarter, he guides you through the process of how to write/prep the essays, especially the first essay, and he doesn't just expect a multiple page essay out of nowhere. The weeks leading up to an essay due date will be almost exclusively used for teaching you how to approach a certain type of essay or how to use a database to get research information for your essay and etc. Almost every lecture is tailored into helping your assignments out in some way. Having complex sentences and flow in your essays will get you a high grade. His class is certainly not an easy A, or even an easy B, but an A is absolutely achievable. If you want to actually take to heart what is being taught and genuinely want to become more proficient in English, take his class.",

Attendance was not mandatory, and honestly was not necessary since whatever he talked about during class was not relevant or helpful to your essays. The only days you need to attend are the days he set for your oral presentations and the days right before the essay is due, this is when he asks for your topic ideas and he'll talk about some. He assigned readings before each lecture from two books, 1984 (Orwell) and Brave New World (Aldous Huxley), but I passed without needing to read the whole book.

She reports people to academic misconduct for plagiarism without even informing them. Literally half the people in her class (including myself) dropped because of the heavy workload. Essay prompts were confusing and boring. She claims the workload is the same for all ENGL001B classes, but when I retook the class with Lorelei Baughman, we had exponentially AND significantly way less work compared to Rory Moore. Speaking of Lorelei Baughman, she's an absolute sweetheart, and an amazing professor. At one point she was wondering why we hardly asked questions, and our class had to explain to her that she does an absolute fine job at explaining. Encourages us to reach out to her. if you ever see her class open TAKE IT. Our class focused on food, and she always assigned these fun readings. Our final was easy, essay prompts were easy.

Even though it was kind of annoying to have a lot of work sometimes it really helped my writing improve in the end. Just make sure you do what he says. ",

Weekly quizzes and hw (basically another quiz) on ilearn based on this week's and last week's material. They're straightforward and open note. There were 3 mts instead of mt + final. Thought this was good bc I'd die if there was a fat cumulative final.  I'm a BCOE major who took this in winter 2021 with Stouthamer online as a filler class...do NOT do this. Registered bc I'm interested in insects and need 12 units but it became my least favorite class ever because of the professor. Lectures prerecorded and sucks the life out of me even at 1.5x speed.  He also grades based on bell curve, so that the 60-90 percentile students are in B range. Cool, right? No, not cool when you're at the 60% percentile with a 86% overall in class. Your grade heavily depends on how well your peers are doing. Rip gpa over some stupid grasshoppers. ",

There is a lot of memorization and information is very specific. Grading scale is also all over the place, would not take again!!",

Lecture and discussion are usually on the same day and attendance is mandatory. Lecture is early in the day and covers the basis of the bees and beekeeping. Although, the professor does upload the lecture slides, they are not helpful at all. I suggest going to lecture and taking notes because he is more of a verbal person. Discussion is solely based on student presentations about scientific articles. Since it is the only thing covered on that day, the presentations are a big part of your grade. However, the professor and TA know that the majority of the students who take this course are not CNAS majors. So they understand if someone has difficulty doing the reading and the presentation and won't hold it against you. For lab, you get to explore the bees habitat (which is the fun part) you get to suit up in a beekeeper suit and work with the bee hives. The TA, other beekeepers from the lab, and Bar and his wife (who is also an entomologist) are present to help students. At the end of the course, you get to make honey and beeswax candles to take him as goodies. \nThere is a midterm that was take home. The final is cumulative, but it's not bad if you took good notes since the majority is just memorization. If not, there is quizlets online on this class that will definitely help you. Overall, a good class ",

The lectures are all over the place. There are no slides or lecture outlines, just him ranting about Chicano history and stuff. Also, he requires our camera to be on for attendance purposes, and most of us just woke up. The readings, though short, are shared through blurry jpgs, so they are tedious to read.   His assignments are film review essays. He makes us watch hour-long documentaries and write about it with a very vague prompt.  Honestly, I learned more from those documentaries than I ever did in his class. He also expects us to email him the assignments instead of having us submit them on ilearn. One of my assignments got lost in his spam folder! He takes his sweet-ass time grading assignments.The midterms and finals are just as bad as the assignments, except the TAs are grading them so each TA has their own guidelines. At least they are take-home. The timeline of this class is also very messed up. Our first assignment is assigned on week 5. Our midterm is on week 7, the same day a homework assignment is due.  Our last assignment is due the day of finals, and also can be submitted hours after the final is due.  This class would work much better asynchronous. Do yourself a favor. Do not take this class. Take a different ethnic studies class. Take Asian-American studies or African American Studies or religion. If you decide to be brave and take this class, take it with friends, join group chats, and have a solid support system. You're going to need it.",

Attending the Zoom lecture was not required and was more of an office hours. He uploaded multiple short videos a week, breaking down the information into smaller chunks so you don't have to sit and drudge through hour-long videos. There are a lot of different species, characteristics, and time periods to remember, but everything was open book so the class itself was not too hard. ",

Easy class because she gives tons of EC opportunities and plus, she drops your lowest HW, midterm, and quiz grade. HW takes about 1-2 hours, but it's just busy work. Final project in the end just tests your knowledge of the concepts in the textbook, and it's about the same as the HW. Some of the questions from the midterms + final were confusing because it wasn't something that was on the concept quizzes or HW, but other than that, this class is a good phys. science breadth that'll also boost your GPA ",

There is 3/4 books you need and weekly readings, but it's manageable if you can schedule everything. I procrastinated all readings til finals week, and I passed but with a C, so this class isnt the hardest but if you put in effort it can be fairly easy. Also, your TA plays a large role on your grade because they are the ones that grade your paper. Go to office hours and show you care about passing, and undoubtably it will boost your grade.",

No exams; just two papers, lots of readings (which I will admit I forgot to do a lot of lol) and a big final project (in groups). Papers can be hard depending on how picky your TA is. If your TA is Clayton, then you're good to go, he's a super chill TA. The second paper was made optional and we got an extension on the final project due to #BLM. Highly recommend Eacott.

Most of your grade depends on the decade assignments, which are short 400+ word essays. The prompts were sometimes confusing, but it didn't take up that much of my time to write. There were 4 of these assignments and it is graded by your TA, so you grade kinda depends on how nice they are and if you basically follow the rubric, it shouldn't be too hard to do well on these essays. Apparently, there was supposed to be one decade assignment per week (pre-COVID), but she changed to biweekly assignments to make it easier for students in the pandemic. She also made the final optional for us. It was a relatively easy A class for most people as long as you complete all the assignments, come to discussion, and do all the extra credit quizzes.",

There are 3 essays, midterm and final. Midterm and final exam are the same format, he gives you 3-6 prompts and he chooses which one you'll have to complete. For the midterm, he gave us about 24 hours to complete and upload to iLearn whereas, for the Final, he'll give you 36 hours to complete and upload. The essay prompts are broad and hard to grasp at times so I suggest you attend a workshop to better understand it, my TA was also broad on what he expected so it made it worst.

Making flashcards to study the definitions are really helpful. One midterm, which is written in blue book, and two tests, which are scantron. Just study the given definitions and clicker questions and it shouldn't be too bad. Final is also bluebook. Two essays on various topics. Make sure to be detailed on the essays, everything is in the textbook or available online so make sure to include the important bits. ",

The class has clicker/attendance which are worth 10% of your grade so be warned. The most important thing in this class is understanding KEY WORDS / BUZZ WORDS. In his essay/midterm instructions or even when he reiterates several times in lecture, he will tell you to follow a certain essay format (introduction, 1-2 paragraphs, conclusion, etc) but do not listen to him. The key is memorizing KEY WORDS to do well on the essays/midterm/final. For example, if a prompt asks about energy changes in the industrial revolution, you only need to say \"energy changed from wood, wind, water to iron, coal, steam\" and that's basically 20% of your grade awarded to you. You do not need to be exceptionally formal; this is not an English class.",

The midterm and final; you're expected to memorize more than 10 prompts, and you're basically expected to write paragraphs about those subjects. The subject material in this class is sub-par.\nWhat really makes this class either suck hard or easy-mode are the graders; you can have all the keywords needed for a prompt, and end up with a D on your paper all because you forgot one keyword that wasn't even part of what the prompt was asking you for. If you're looking for an upper-division DEPTH course, don't take this class. It's a trap.",

He also did things like give us a bunch of things due at one time during finals week when we were all stressed out. He also wasn't very considerate of COVID messing with our time/money. Unlike most other professors, those of us who had to get a job/extra jobs during school because of the pandemic weren't accommodated in terms of participation we had to miss (and it was 25% of final grade). He was also really inconsiderate about money, for example he said that a $50 2nd textbook cost couldn't be waived but it's \"just a fraction of your tuition anyway\" (he also mentioned during this announcement that people told him they were struggling to afford food/rent and he basically responded with \"That sucks but I can't do anything about it,\" it was unbelievable).

It's nothing like the content we learned during lectures, or like our homework. Your best bet is to study the textbook (even though we barely go over it). Discussion quizzes are based off of textbook questions, and he creates questions using the textbook exercises for the \"big\" exams. Also, go to office hours since he helps go over content plus gives hints about exams that he doesn't give during lecture. He provides you with everything you need: section questions to study for quizzes, what material will be on the exams, small curves, but again he makes the class more tough than it really is.

If you need anything, just contact him and he'd be happy to help you out however you need. Lectures were pretty boring (although I find all math lectures boring) but it was easy to follow. I took Calc BC in high school, so having had a lot of practice with integrals, this class was a breeze for me. My friend, who took Calc AB in high school, was less familiar with some of the material but they're still getting through the class with only mild difficulty; so make sure you pay attention in lecture!!!

Quizzes are given out during discussion; the problems depend on who your TA is. The midterm wasn't too bad, but you need to put in the time and effort to study.

Considering the rigor of this course I honestly don't think it gets better than this cuz he explains everythinggg in depth and does it pretty well. He's also super reasonable and understanding. So try to get him if you take this course :) In terms of content, if you're a freshman and you didn't take any AP Calc courses but placed into this, its definitely gonna be overwhelming. There's always gonna be kids who know more than you since they had more experience with it. You can do well even if you procrastinate but beware that it's a LOT of cramming. Make sure you study for the quizzes because it's easy to forget considering how much we have to remember. Be attentive during lecture, you miss one thing and can get lost and then needa rewatch it. Also, he monitors the chat so you don't have to speak to participate. Overall, a rigorous course but he's a really good professor so you'll be in good hands :)",

The material itself is not hard but it is a proof based class so sometimes it can be tricky to fully justify and understand certain concepts. Lectures and discussions were very useful and I would highly recommend office hours, they are very helpful for the homework. We had 6 homework assignments, 6 quizzes (lowest quiz dropped), 2 midterms and a final. Midterms were very fair and as long as you do understand the hw you should at least get 80%, only a small portion of it was tricky. The exam was cumulative so it was a little harder, but still extremely fair. I did well on the hw and quizzes and averaged about 80% for the exams which gave me an 85% for the class which was an A-.",

They were made up of problems from the book and problems he gave during lecture and we weren't required to do all of them. We had the option of doing the project in a group or individually (I was in a group). The professor barely gave us any idea what to do on it. He said a presentation is usually mandatory but because all this took place during the pandemic, the presentation was extra credit. Be sure to take notes during lecture because he doesn't post his online. Also, I went to every lecture and discussion but apparently that wasn't enough to get full points for attendance and participation. My final grade was a B.

Midterm 1, 4/5 problems were seen previously in either homework or quizzes. Midterm 2, 3/5 problems were seen already. Go to office hours to check if your solutions are 100% correct, so you don't miss any points on the exam.

Every time she says hint hint or wink wink, that's an indication you'll see that problem either on a quiz, midterm, or final. Take her hints seriously if you want an A. Also go to her office hours for extra credit. Great professor",

Luckily, the last half of the class was taught by Dr. Morrison, who was much more straightforward in what she expected of us. The final was legitimately difficult. Rao doesn't give \"-\" final overall grades, so you could go from an A to a B+, B directly to a C+, etc. Definitely wouldn't recommend unless you want your ass kicked by a massive GPA dropper like this. Also, Rao likes to eat away at your grade with hard pop quizzes in lecture. Memorization is heavily tested in this course.",

I HIGHLY suggest getting Akshay Ganesh for TA. He releases his personal notes the day before his discussion and they are extremely helpful.

There is a test every week so go to office hours every week because everything is built ontop of everything so if you dont understand something from a previous week it will harm you the entire quarter.

You're going to write two papers, with the first paper being 10% of your grade and the second paper being 15%, but both are only 1.5 pages long. The midterm was easy for me and I anticipate the final on being equally simple. On his exams, he dedicates 5 questions for you to explain your previous answers and, if he thinks they're acceptable explanations, you will be able to earn the points back if you missed the question. Overall, pretty enjoyable experience; I would take him again.",

Does online clickers for credit so class is kinda mandatory and I never read his reading notes before lecture, but doing that would've helped me .\nPHYS 2A is known as a weeder class, but I learned a lot and walked out with a B+ because of Prof Ellison so definitely take it with him!\"",

Also try to get as many points as possible on the poll questions because the amount to as much as a midterm. We had 2 midterms and a cumulative final.

Content-wise, it has some topics from gen chem, which makes it familiar and a bit easier to understand. His exams were all multiple choice and open note. Quite a few problems were similar to practice exams and it was not difficult to do well in the class as long as you know how to do practice exam questions and the lecture examples. A lot of it is just knowing how to use the formulas/equations, so sometimes just knowing how to do math can help you solve the problems! Since the exams are on the easier side, he doesn't curve much so 90 = A, 75 = B, and 60 = C, but if averages are low, he may change the cutoffs slightly. The professor you take for physics in general will determine how well you do since some professors give more difficult exams, but will curve or adjust cutoffs accordingly.",

The only perk is that his study guide/discussion questions is almost exactly like the exams. He changes the number, but it's not difficult to grasp. ",

Even if you understand the physics behind all these concepts perfectly, his questions feel like a puzzle. As far as I can tell, the other two professors make extremely \"easy\" straightforward questions and the curve is usually pretty nice. \n\nIn the past, you would want to avoid Mills because he makes the hardest questions and he doesn't teach that well but now that all the professors are making the final, it might actually be beneficial to have him as a professor because you could get used to his madness before the final.

Daily reading quizzes are fair and homework and quizzes are fairly easy (and fair lol). The midterm will kill a great portion of the class. Since it was his first time teaching a lot of us were unprepared for the difficulty of the midterm, but aside from that the material itself is okay (you will need to sit and think about it though).\n\nQuantum physics (2nd half) hurts. It makes no sense, and everything is counterintuitive. The textbook is exceedingly complicated and the homework problems are often never going to show on quizzes or the final (a few essential ones did but you will be able to tell what those are). By the way, Dr. Long's quizzes and final are based almost entirely on lecture notes (which he posts), but if you are cool with going to lecture, do so from time to time as sometimes some of the things he says reflects what you could see on a quiz.\n\n\nThe math gets so complicated you will need to use Mathematica. You literally only do that so you can get homework points smh. This class will force you to constantly ask the most fundamental of questions only for you to still be confused. Good luck!",

Reading the textbook isn't super super important, so you can probably get away with not reading it because she mentions how theres only like two to three questions on the exam where the information comes from the book. Key to doing well in the class is memorization and understanding the notes she post on iLearn. Lecture is important to as she says things that rewards those students who attend lecture, but can get from a friend. Got a B+ and read the book and went to lecture, but beware of the Neuroscience part, required a lot of memorization but is doable. Note... on her power point there are presenter notes when you download them... OPEN THOSE and study those too.. questions from midterms and final were from there I vividly remember that. ",

Chapter in the textbook every week (although you don't really have to but the textbook is super interactive so it was very easy to read), Quizzes for every chapter (but you can just keep going till you get 100%, questions are unlimited), and then an assignment every week (but it was lowk busy work, only takes about 20 minutes). At the beginning of the week she also sends out what should be done for the week which is superrr helpful. Oh and media project at the end (I just did a tiktok and got a 102%, super easy) and UCR research hours (just participate in a study) Take this class!!! You'll enjoy it. Got an A+",

Unlike most other professors, those of us who had to get a job/extra jobs during school because of the pandemic weren't accommodated in terms of participation we had to miss (and it was 25% of final grade). He was also really inconsiderate about money, for example he said that a $50 2nd textbook cost couldn't be waived but it's \"just a fraction of your tuition anyway\" (he also mentioned during this announcement that people told him they were struggling to afford food/rent and he basically responded with \"That sucks but I can't do anything about it,\" it was unbelievable).

I have a few complaints. 1. There is a lot of reading. They are mostly 5-10pg articles and they average about 7 different articles A WEEK. The exams are reading heavy so you have to read the articles to do well. 2. The TAs are absolutely useless. It sucks enough that all lectures are recorded so you have no contact with the professor. My TA took an average of 1 week to respond to my emails, which would be too late anyway. The only actual class time is during discussion and most of the TAs for this class will straight up say to not ask them about the material because they don't have time to look at it. For exams, they tell you to do the reading, give you a study guide of what they think will be on the exam and call it a day. 2. There are 4 midterms and 1 final exam. Basically, there is an exam every other week on Fridays, so be careful about what classes you might have on Fridays. 4. The assignments are tedious and boring and the TAs grade harshly for things like citations, grammar, word count, etc. If you go over or under the word requirement, you will get points deducted. 5. The professors are not empathetic. A peer of mine got sick with covid and was in the hospital. When they let the professor know since they missed an assignment, the professor said that they should have told him sooner and the student received a 0 on the assignment. Good things about the course: 1. open-note exams 2. recorded lectures if that's your thing 3. Sometimes curves exam scores. 4. They drop your lowest exam score. (somehow got an A, but still. Good luck lol)",

This class is basically Busywork: The Class, and I would strongly, STRONGLY advise against taking this class if you don't need to. I took this class for credits, and the amount of time I had to put into this class was ridiculous. I ended up having to put more time in this class than the other two classes I took this quarter combined. The grading for this class is based around biweekly exams (that's 5 exams total - 5!!) that are open-book, but because they are open-book, the professor takes that as an excuse to grill you on minute details of the readings assigned for that week. Readings are pretty lengthy, and on top of doing readings as well as studying for each of the 5 exams, you are also given writing assignments that progressively get longer on creating your own public policy. I did fine on these writing assignments, as well as the exams. It feels like you only have to do the bare minimum to succeed in this class, but the bare minimum is still a ridiculous amount of time.

I got a B, and I read every chapter and attended all the lectures. She is funny AF, so thats always a positive of attending lecture. Does not post lecture slides, but can get them if you make friends. Otherwise a good and insightful class to take, but reading is required for a good grade.",

You have to actively participate during Zoom and turn on your camera. He takes attendance. The class consists of using McGraw broken down into 8 sections and everyday (Mon-Thur) the assignment deadline is due the next day before class starts instead of 11:59pm. There\u2019s also chapter quizzes based on the homework and textbook. Two writing compositions during class time. Midterm is an individual oral presentation. I feel like this class was way easier than high school but I tend to forget everything so it was basically a review course but also relearning what I forgot. He wasn\u2019t mean or rude like I hear about the other Spanish professors. The class was chill. Take him if you can! If you know more on speaking Spanish then this class would be easy for you. ",

However, the textbook assignments/quizzes are 30% of your grade, so do good on those and try to get B's on the other assignments. Be prepared because the quizzes can take a while to complete because of how lengthy the questions are. Plus the textbook was online and terrible (not to mention it was 50 bucks).",

The online textbook is very specific about what kinds of answers it accepts, so be prepared to go into Office Hours often to fight to get points back. Pretty much daily homework assignments (30 minutes max), 2 short essays, 4 quizzes, two oral assessments (1 presentation, and 1 conversation), and then an online final in the same format as the quizzes/homework. Sounds like a lot, but it is spaced out nicely over the 10 weeks. For my class, cameras were required to be on, which made the class really enjoyable! Nice to interact with people. ",

There is also a weekly lab using Minitab 19, and it is really easy. The material is mostly just different procedures/concepts of statistics used in business and manufacturing situations to determine quality of products/processes. Equations are WAY easier than in most statistics classes and you are allowed to make a \"cheat sheet\" for exams so you don't really have to memorize any. DEFINITELY useful for Business majors; a bit less useful for Statistics majors/minors in terms of material we will use someday, but it's good for seeing how to apply statistics in real life. ",

It's Web Assign with three overall submission tries meaning each try counts for the entire assignment. The HW's are insanely long to do and all pretty much word problems so if you hated those well here they are to fuck you one last time before you graduate. The biggest helpful advice I can give you is to recognize what type of question each problem is asking you and to do each HW before the Quizzes.\n\nThe Quizzes themselves are the HW so if you do them before they are due you'll have a fighting chance. A lot of people didn't pick this up until too late. Every discussion ends with a quizz and yeah you get a quizz and HW literally a day before the final. Jill has no mercy.\n\nAll in all if you can get 90% and above on the HW's and Quizzes you may just pass this class but it won't be an easy task. THE HW IS HARD. This is a heavy class to balance and if you don't put time and effort into this class you'll definitely repeat it. ",
